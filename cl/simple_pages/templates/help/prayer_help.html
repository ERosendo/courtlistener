  <h1 id="about">Help with Pray and Pay&nbsp;Project</h1>
  <p class="lead">Since 2009, CourtListener has helped people keep up with new cases and legal topics.</p>
  <p>As part of the pray and pay project, we now allow users to crowdfund federal court documents.</p>

  <h2 id="pray-and-pay">Pray and Pay Project</h2>
  <p>PACER is the largest paywall on the internet, with thousands of new documents filed daily. These documents are expensive.
  </p>
  <p>To advance our mission of open access to the courts, we allow you to both request documents and to pay it forward by purchasing those requested by others in the community.
  </p>
  <p>PACER waives the first $30.00 of purchases by anyone in each quarter. Leveraging this will allow users to have more access to court documents.
  </p>
  <p>Since the project's creation, users have fulfilled <span class="bold">{{ granted_stats.prayer_count|intcomma }}</span> prayers for <span class="bold">{{ granted_stats.distinct_count|intcomma }}</span> distinct documents, for a total cost of <span class="bold">${{ granted_stats.total_cost }}</span>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
  <p>In order to faciliate the broadest possible access to court documents and prevent a single user from controlling the requests, we maintain a daily limit of <span class="bold">{{ daily_quota }}</span> requests. This is a rolling limit over 24 hour periods.
  </p>
  <p>Requests are ranked on a <a href="{% url "top_prayers" %}">leaderboard</a> based on a function that incorporates both how many users have requested a particular document and how old those requests are. As requests are fulfilled, they are removed from the leaderboard.

  <h3 id="creating-prayer">Creating a Prayer</h3>
  <p>To create a Prayer, find a document you are interested in on a particular docket, and press the üôè button on the right. The number on the button is how many others have requested the document. If you have reached your daily limit, you will be informed by a message.
  </p>
  <p>
    {% comment %} <img src="{% static "png/docket-alert-button.png" %}"
         alt="screenshot of the prayer button"
         class="img-responsive img-rounded shadow center-block"
         height="31"
         width="94"> {% endcomment %}
  </p>
  <p>That's all there is to it. You'll receive an email as soon as someone purchases the document and it is uploaded to RECAP.
  </p>
  <p>Here's an example of what an email might look like:</p>
  <p class="v-offset-above-2">
    {% comment %} <a href="{% static "png/alert-example.png" %}">
      <img src="{% static "png/alert-example.png" %}"
           width="749"
           height="529"
           class="img-responsive img-rounded center-block shadow"
      >
    </a> {% endcomment %}
  </p>
  <p class="v-offset-below-2 gray alt small">
    (Click for full size version.)
  </p>

  <h3 id="deleting-prayer">Deleting a Prayer</h3>
  <p>To delete a Prayer, navigate to a docket you have previously requested a document from, and press the üôè button on the right again. Alternatively, you can navigate to the {% if user.is_authenticated %}<a href="{% url 'user_prayers' user.username %}">list of prayers in your profile</a>{% else %}list of prayers in your profile{% endif %} and mass delete from there. It is not possible to delete a prayer once it is fulfilled.
  </p>
  <p>

         alt="screenshot of the delete button"
         class="img-responsive img-rounded shadow center-block"
         height="31"
         width="119"> {% endcomment %}
  </p>

  <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
  <p>We do not currently support requests to purchase docket information such as attorneys, parties, or docket text such as minute orders, but we hope to support that in the future.
  </p>
  <p>We also hope to allow users (such as freelance journalists) to create public wishlists of documents to share with others.
  </p>
  <p>Please stay tuned!</p>
