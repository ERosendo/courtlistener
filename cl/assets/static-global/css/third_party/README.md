# Third-Party CSS

This directory contains stylesheets for third-party libraries used in new templates.

- All files are **upstream code** and must **not be edited directly**.
- If the stylesheet is widely used and needs to be available globally, import it in Tailwind's input file. This ensures the code is minified.
- To override styles, use the appropriate layer in Tailwind's `input.css` file.
