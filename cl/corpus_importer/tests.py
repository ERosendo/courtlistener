The Petition alleged, among other things,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violations of the Maryland Lawyers\' Rules of Professional Conduct ("MLRPC") 3.3 (Candor Toward the Tribunal) and 8.4 (Misconduct).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those charges arise from misleading complaints <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="2" class="page-label">**190</a>Respondent filed with the District Court of Maryland sitting in Baltimore County while representing the Council of Unit Owners of Kingswood Commons, Inc. ("Kingswood"), a homeowners\' association, in several debt collection cases. Specifically, Respondent inflated the damages sought on the complaint form by thirty percent without separately indicating, as the form requires, that this increase constituted his attorney\'s fees.</p>\n    <p id="p-10">Pursuant to Maryland Rules 19-722(a) and 19-727, this Court designated the Honorable Keith R. Truffer ("hearing judge") of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. The hearing was held on March 13, 2018. Respondent testified and presented evidence on his behalf. On April 27, 2018, the hearing judge issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Respondent did not commit any violations of the MLRPC.</p>\n    <p id="p-11">Bar Counsel, on behalf of Petitioner, took no issue with the hearing judge\'s findings of fact but filed exceptions to each conclusion of law. Petitioner asserts that Respondent violated MLRPC 3.3(a)(1) and 8.4 because he provided the District Court with false information, misled the District Court with that information, and engaged in disreputable conduct. Petitioner also excepts to the hearing judge\'s finding of certain mitigating factors and asks us to consider other aggravating factors in addition to the ones the hearing judge found. Respondent counters that although he made a mistake, he did not violate any of the MLRPC.</p>\n    <p id="p-12">On October 9, 2018, this Court heard oral argument in this matter. Petitioner asks us to disbar or, in the alternative, suspend Respondent. Respondent requests that we affirm the hearing judge\'s legal conclusions and dismiss this action. For <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="2" class="page-label">**191</a>the following reasons, we agree with Petitioner that Respondent violated MLRPC 3.3 and 8.4 and, consequently, suspend Respondent from practicing law indefinitely with the right to apply for reinstatement no sooner than six months after the suspension takes effect.</p>\n    <p id="p-13"><strong>I.</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-14"><strong>A. The Hearing Judge\'s Findings of Fact</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-15"><em>1. Background</em></p>\n    <p id="p-16">Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar in 1974. In 1979, after a five-year <a id="p825" href="#p825" data-label="825" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*825</a>stint as an Assistant State\'s Attorney, Respondent transitioned to private practice. On June 4, 1990, Respondent was convicted of money laundering and transporting stolen goods, <em>United States v. Steinhorn</em> , <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/f2d/927/195/#p196" index="0" case-ids="1797111">927 F.2d 195</extracted-citation>, 196 (4th Cir. 1991), and subsequently, in September 1990, this Court suspended him from practicing law in Maryland. Thereafter, on February 1, 1994, following affirmance of his convictions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Court disbarred Respondent by consent. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\'n v.

Since his reinstatement, Respondent has handled exclusively debt collection cases, representing homeowner associations, small businesses, and bail bondsmen. In one such matter, Respondent assisted Kingswood in collecting past due condominium fees from several condominium unit owners.</p>\n    <p id="p-18"><em>2. Respondent\'s Court Filings</em></p>\n    <p id="p-19">As part of his work for Kingswood, Respondent filed two form complaints-entitled DC-CV-001, Complaint/Application <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="2" class="page-label">**192</a>and Affidavit in Support of Judgment-with the District Court of Maryland sitting in Baltimore County in 2014. The first complaint, filed on January 14, 2014, sought to recover $9,120 in delinquent condominium fees from Aileen Pratt, a condominium unit owner. The second complaint, filed on April 2, 2014, also sought to collect $9,120 in outstanding condominium fees from Jason Green, another condominium unit owner. Respondent submitted affidavits in support of those claims, which were signed by Marc Greenberg ("Greenberg"), an agent of Kingswood. Greenberg relied on Respondent\'s representations about the accuracy of those filings.</p>\n    <p id="p-20">The $9,120 figure listed on both complaints represented unpaid condominium fees for a four-year period (2011-2014) plus Respondent\'s thirty-percent attorney\'s fee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, of the $9,120 sought in the complaints, $6,912 was for the outstanding HOA fees and $2,208 was for attorney\'s fees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent conjoined the unpaid assessments ($6,912) with the agreed-upon attorney\'s fees ($2,208) in each complaint filed with the court, listing one figure ($9,120) in the damages line, leaving the line designated for attorney\'s fees blank (see image below).</p>\n    <p id="p-21"><a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="2" class="page-label">**193</a><a id="p826" href="#p826" data-label="826" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*826</a><em>3. The Complaint to the Attorney Grievance Commission</em></p>\n    <p id="p-22">In 2016, Kingswood terminated Respondent\'s representation and replaced him with Brian Fellner, Esq. ("Fellner"). Fellner discovered that Respondent did not timely remit several payments he collected for Kingswood. Fellner then filed a complaint with Petitioner, alleging that Respondent\'s delay was unwarranted. Bar Counsel investigated and determined that Respondent was also inflating the amount of damages sought in his court filings, and that he failed to rectify the issue once it was called to his attention. Petitioner concluded that such conduct violated MLRPC 3.3 and 8.4, among other charged violations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n    <p id="p-23"><em>4. Respondent\'s Testimony</em></p>\n    <p id="p-24">During the hearing on his conduct, Respondent "candidly admitted" that he made a mistake, and he "denied any intent to deceive the court." He testified that he only sought to collect that which was rightfully owed to him based on his fee agreement with Kingswood.</p>\n    <p id="p-25">The hearing judge found, as a matter of fact, that Respondent\'s testimony was credible and that Respondent never intended to make a false statement to the District Court. The hearing judge was persuaded by the fact that Respondent did not personally benefit from his conduct. The judge was also swayed by Respondent\'s sincere remorse and his implementation <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="2" class="page-label">**194</a>of new office procedures to prevent those issues from reoccurring.</p>\n    <p id="p-26"><strong>B. The Hearing Judge\'s Conclusions of Law</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-27">Based on the record and the above-summarized findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded that Petitioner failed to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MLRPC 3.3(a)(1) and 8.4 (a), (c), and (d). As noted at the outset, Petitioner has filed exceptions to the hearing judge\'s conclusions of law.</p>\n    <p id="p-28"><strong>II.</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-29"><strong>Standard of Review</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-30">"In attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction and conducts an independent review of the record." <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\'n v.

In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v.

We therefore overturned the hearing judge\'s legal conclusion and sanctioned Mr. Taylor, "notwithstanding the hearing judge\'s finding that there was no ... misuse of client funds." <em><extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/md/405/697/#p707" index="29" case-ids="3740414">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/md/405/697/#p707" index="29" case-ids="3740414"> at 715</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/md/405/697/#p707" index="30" case-ids="3740414">955 A.2d 755</extracted-citation>. Likewise, here, our <em>de novo</em> review leads us to the conclusion that Respondent violated MLRPC 3.3(a)(1), notwithstanding the hearing judge\'s finding that Respondent acted with no intent to deceive anyone.</p>\n    <p id="p-40">We need not look any further than Respondent\'s testimony to reach this conclusion. Respondent testified that he reviewed each complaint to ensure its accuracy before filing it with the court. He further testified that he "<em>knew</em> what the attorney\'s fees were," that he "<em>knew</em> what the division was going to be subsequent to the payment of the judgment" ($6,912 for the debt and $2,208 for attorney\'s fees), and that those figures <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="2" class="page-label">**197</a>"should have been separated."<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Emphasis added). Yet, despite this knowledge, Respondent did not separate those figures on the complaint forms he filed with the District Court, and he did not file corrected forms thereafter, even after this issue was called to his attention. It follows that Respondent knowingly submitted false information to the court-that the underlying debt was $9,120, when, in fact, it was only $6,912-which he failed ever to correct. Consequently, clear and convincing evidence demonstrates that Respondent violated MLRPC 3.3(a)(1).</p>\n    <p id="p-41">That the hearing judge found as a fact that Respondent did not intend to deceive the court, did not harm anyone, and did not benefit from this practice-findings that Bar Counsel has not excepted to and we thus adopt-is immaterial to our analysis. What matters for purposes of finding an MLRPC 3.3(a)(1) violation is whether an attorney knows that the information he or she presents to the tribunal is incorrect. <em>Ward</em> , <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/md/394/1/#p32" index="31" case-ids="532191">394 Md. at 32</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/md/394/1/#p32" index="32" case-ids="532191">904 A.2d 477</extracted-citation>.

He challenges the Board\'s recommitment order that extended his maximum sentence date based on an out-of-state conviction, asserting the Pennsylvania crime used to discern the recommitment range was more severe. He also argues the Board abused its discretion in denying him credit for his time spent at liberty on parole and inadequately explaining its denial. We vacate the Board\'s order, and remand to the Board to explain its credit determination sufficiently to enable appellate review.</p>\n    <p id="p-10"><strong>I. Background</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-11">In 1998, Marshall was sentenced to 11 to 22 years in prison for murder in the third degree and robbery, with a maximum date of January 15, 2019. He obtained release on parole on March 3, 2008. Almost nine years later, as a result of a traffic stop in Delaware, Marshall was charged with multiple crimes related to his possession of 200.49 grams of powder cocaine and 67.94 grams of crack cocaine. Specifically, a court in the State of Delaware, Kent County convicted Marshall for "DDEAL Tier 4 (F) Cocaine" under 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4752, and it sentenced him to eight years, custody level 5. Certified Record (C.R.) at 17 (Sentence Order, 5/10/17). Delaware then extradited Marshall to serve his sentence in Pennsylvania.</p>\n    <p id="p-12">The new conviction subjected Marshall to a parole revocation hearing. Marshall acknowledged his conviction, and signed a waiver of his right to a hearing. C.R. at 36. The parole revocation hearing report recommended "taking [his] street time" because Marshall "was on parole for Murder and was convicted of felony drug related crimes." C.R. at 35.</p>\n    <p id="p-13">As a result of his out-of-state conviction, the Board recommitted Marshall to serve 24 months as a convicted parole violator (CPV). In determining the appropriate recommitment range, the Board determined that Marshall\'s Delaware conviction most closely related to the Pennsylvania crime <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>of possession with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance (cocaine) under Section 13(a)(30) of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act (Controlled Substance Act),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that carries a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years. <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2075.1" index="0">37 Pa. Code \u00a7 75.1</extracted-citation>. Pursuant to <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Pa.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2075.2" index="1">37 Pa. Code \u00a7 75.2</extracted-citation>, the presumptive recommitment range for that new offense is 18 to 24 months. The Board did not award Marshall credit for his time spent at liberty on parole because of his "felony drug related crimes." C.R. at 49. Based on his conviction, the Board recalculated Marshall\'s maximum sentence date as April 29, 2028.</p>\n    <p id="p-14">Through counsel, Marshall filed an administrative appeal of the Board\'s recommitment order. The Board issued a decision, affirming and explaining the term of recommitment. Because it stated a reason for denying Marshall credit for his time spent at liberty on parole, the Board deemed moot his challenge to its exercise of discretion in its denial of credit. C.R. at 73.</p>\n    <p id="p-15">Marshall filed a timely petition for review to this Court (Petition) seeking an order vacating the Board\'s decision and remanding to the Board to modify his recommitment using the appropriate range corresponding to his criminal conduct, possession of cocaine. He seeks credit for almost nine years spent at liberty on parole, and a recalculation of his maximum sentence date to reflect that credit.</p>\n    <p id="p-16"><strong>II. Discussion</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-17">On appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Marshall asserts the Board violated his due process rights when it did not notify him, at the time he waived his revocation hearing, that a new maximum sentence date was a possible consequence. He challenges the Board\'s authority to alter his original maximum date beyond his judicially-imposed sentence. He also argues the Board applied an incorrect recommitment range corresponding to a more severe offense. Using the most closely related crime of possession, as opposed to possession with intent to distribute, he maintains the appropriate recommitment range was 3 to 6 months, not 18 to 24 months. In addition, Marshall contends the Board abused its discretion when it denied him credit for time spent at liberty on parole, and he challenges the adequacy and accuracy of its reason for doing so.</p>\n    <p id="p-18"><strong>A. Notice</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-19">First, we address Marshall\'s argument that the Board violated his due process rights because it did not notify him, at the time he waived his revocation hearing, that a possible consequence was a new maximum sentence date. The Board responds that Marshall waived this challenge when he did not raise it during the administrative proceedings. We agree.</p>\n    <p id="p-20">The record shows Marshall did not challenge the adequacy of notice for the revocation hearing in his several-page administrative remedies form. C.R. at 53-60. Significantly, Marshall\'s counsel filed his administrative appeal. C.R. at 53. On the pre-printed administrative remedies form, counsel checked the box for "Violation of Constitutional Law (Due process, double jeopardy, etc.)." C.R. at 53. Other than checking that box, there is no suggestion of this issue for the Board\'s review. Marshall\'s failure to raise this issue before the <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>Board results in waiver. <em>Chesson v. Pa.

Cmwlth. 2012).</p>\n    <p id="p-21">In any event, Marshall cites no authority for the proposition that the Board must provide specific notice as to all possible legal consequences of a parole revocation hearing.</p>\n    <p id="p-22"><strong>B. Recalculation of Maximum Sentence Date</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-23">Next, we consider Marshall\'s contention that in recalculating his maximum sentence date, the Board imposed additional time beyond his judicially-authorized sentence.</p>\n    <p id="p-24">When a parolee violates the terms and conditions of his parole, the Board may recommit him to serve all or part of the remainder of his original sentence. <em>Yates v.

C.R. at 17. Although the charges included various crimes under Section 4752 of the Delaware Penal Code, Marshall\'s conviction record does not specify a subsection. Premised on this omission, Marshall claims his crime amounted to mere possession of a controlled substance, not possession with intent to deliver as the Board found. We disagree.</p>\n    <p id="p-31">Section 4752 of the Delaware Penal Code is captioned "drug dealing-aggravated possession; class B felony." 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4752. It consists of five subsections, each of which includes the offense "possesses a controlled substance," in various quantity levels, with or without aggravating factors. <em><extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/96/556/#p1315" index="14" case-ids="1346084">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p>\n    <p id="p-32">Notwithstanding Marshall\'s contentions, none of these offenses is analogous to mere possession of a controlled substance under Pennsylvania law. Thus, we are unpersuaded by Marshall\'s argument that Section 13(a)(16) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(16), is the most closely related crime. First, that provision pertains to possession of a controlled substance "by a person not registered under this act, or a practitioner not registered or licensed by the appropriate State Board ..." without regard to the quantity of the drug. <em><extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/96/556/#p1315" index="15" case-ids="1346084">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Second, violating that provision is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of one year under Section 13(b) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(b), for which the presumptive recommitment range is 3 to 6 months. Third, in reviewing other subsections in the same section, Section 13(30) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), is more analogous to Marshall\'s conduct in Delaware. Section 13(a)(30) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), classifies possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance as a felony punishable by a maximum term of 10 years in prison. Significantly, Marshall\'s Delaware conviction was also a felony, for which he received an eight-year sentence.</p>\n    <p id="p-33">Despite that the Sentencing Order does not specify the subsection of Section 4752 of the Delaware Penal Code, it states the conviction corresponds to a Tier 4 quantity. Notably, subsection 1 sets forth this quantity in the offense; it reads: "manufactures, delivers, or <em>possesses with intent to manufacture or deliver</em> a controlled substance in a <em>Tier 4 quantity</em>." 16 Del. C. \u00a7 4752(1) (emphasis added). Therefore, the conduct underlying Marshall\'s conviction most closely relates to the Pennsylvania crime of possession <em>with intent</em> to deliver under Section 13(a)(30) of the Controlled Substance Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), as the Board concluded. The Board did not err in utilizing the presumptive range corresponding to that crime.</p>\n    <p id="p-34">This Court will not interfere with the Board\'s discretion as long as the amount of backtime the Board imposed was within the applicable presumptive range. <em>Ward v.

However, the Court did not set forth criteria for such a statement, noting only that it need not "be extensive and a single sentence explanation is likely sufficient in most instances." <em><extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/466/" index="22" case-ids="12323540,12278111">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at 475 n.12.</p>\n    <p id="p-39">Here, the Board\'s reason for denying Marshall credit for time spent at liberty on parole consisted of four words: "felony drug related crimes." C.R. at 49. Although the word "felony" connotes the severity of the offense, it remains unclear how a drug-related conviction warrants denying credit for almost nine years of street time, which is more than the sentence Marshall received for his new conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, the phrase implies he committed multiple felony drug crimes when he was convicted of just one. <em>See</em> Pet\'r\'s Br. at 10, 19-22.</p>\n    <p id="p-40">Recently, when presented with a <em>Pittman</em> challenge to the sufficiency of a reason, this Court found a five-word reason for denying credit for street time "just barely sufficient." <em>See</em> <em>Smoak v.

Cmwlth. 2018) ("unresolved drug and alcohol issues" was adequate). In <em>Smoak</em>, the Board\'s stated reason indicated multiple issues of an ongoing nature. There, the parolee was convicted on drug-related offenses, and was recommitted when he attempted to furnish drug-free urine to pass a drug test. The reason was accurate and related to the parolee\'s offenses. This Court was able to assess the Board\'s exercise of discretion in denying Smoak credit for approximately two years of street time.</p>\n    <p id="p-41">Since the Court decided <em>Pittman</em>, this Court assessed the Board\'s exercise of discretion in a number of cases. <em>See,</em> <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hayward v.

The significance of the "drug-related" modifier of crime is also unclear from this record. The record does not indicate that his prior conviction was drug related, or otherwise suggest recidivism. As to the commission of a felony while on parole, the commission of a felony could be one of the factors that the Board considers when exercising its discretion to award or withhold credit; however, standing alone, the commission of a felony is an insufficient articulation of the Board\'s reasoning.</p>\n    <p id="p-46">Our task here is to evaluate whether the Board abused its discretion in denying Marshall credit for almost nine years of street time for conviction of a drug-related felony. The Board\'s articulated reason simply restates the conviction without an individual assessment of the facts surrounding Marshall\'s parole revocation.

Ch. 97 Subch. H (relating to registration of sexual offenders).</blockquote>\n    <p id="p-57">Under this provision, the General Assembly has mandated that a parolee who is recommitted for a felony that is not violent or is not a sexual offense remains eligible for street time unless the Board articulates reasons that a longer period of incarceration is warranted for rehabilitative reasons. The Board cannot take away street time to punish a parolee just because he committed a non-excluded felony while on parole. Courts impose punishment, not the Board. If prior offenses auger in favor of more time in prison, it is up to the sentencing judge to take that into consideration <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>when determining an appropriate sentence on the new felony.</p>\n    <p id="p-58">Moreover, under 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6138(a)(2.1), the General Assembly intended the Board to award street time unless there are exceptional circumstances that require the Board to take it away. While those circumstances can include the facts underlying the new felony, those facts have to be weighed against other factors before street time can be taken away. For example, if parole is revoked for felony theft that was committed to obtain drug money, then the Board could take away street time so that there is sufficient time for the parolee to receive drug treatment in prison. However, that may not be a sufficient reason to take the time away if the sentence on the larceny charge is sufficient for the parolee to complete drug treatment. As this example illustrates, each situation is extremely fact specific requiring the Board to go into detail to explain the reasoning behind its decision not to award street time.</p>\n    <footnote label="1">\n      <p id="p-61">Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, <em>as</em> <em>amended</em>, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30).</p>\n    </footnote>\n    <footnote label="2">\n      <p id="p-62">"Our review of the Board\'s decision is limited to determining whether constitutional rights were violated, whether the decision is in accordance with the law, or whether necessary findings are supported by substantial evidence." <em>Kerak v.

Facts and Procedural History</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-10"><strong>{\u00b6 2}</strong> While on postrelease control for a prior felony conviction, appellee, Dustin Bishop, was indicted on one count of possession of heroin, a fifth-degree felony, and one count of possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor.</p>\n    <p id="p-11"><strong>{\u00b6 3}</strong> Bishop pleaded guilty to the possession count, and the state dismissed the drug-paraphernalia count. At Bishop\'s plea hearing, the trial court informed Bishop that the court could place him on postrelease control for the possession offense. It also informed him that if he committed a new felony while on that postrelease control, the court could sentence him to serve one year in prison or the time remaining on his postrelease control, whichever was longer. The trial <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>court did not inform Bishop that once he pleaded guilty to the possession offense, the court would have the authority under R.C. 2929.141 to terminate Bishop\'s existing postrelease control and impose a prison term that he would serve consecutively to the term of imprisonment imposed for the possession offense. The trial court accepted Bishop\'s guilty plea and set the matter for sentencing.</p>\n    <p id="p-12"><strong>{\u00b6 4}</strong> The trial court sentenced Bishop to serve a nine-month term of imprisonment for the possession offense. For the postrelease-control violation, the court ordered Bishop to serve a one-year prison term under R.C. 2929.141 consecutively to the sentence for the possession offense.</p>\n    <p id="p-13"><strong>{\u00b6 5}</strong> Bishop appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals, raising two assignments of error. Bishop first argued that he had not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily pleaded guilty to the possession offense because the trial court had not informed him of its authority under R.C. 2929.141 to terminate his postrelease control and to order him to serve a prison term consecutively to any term of imprisonment imposed for the felony offense to which he was pleading guilty.

The Second District Court of Appeals has held that the trial court must inform a defendant who is on postrelease control and is pleading guilty to a new felony offense of the trial court\'s authority to revoke the defendant\'s postrelease control and impose a prison term to be served consecutively to any term of imprisonment it imposes for that new felony offense. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-8332" index="23">2017-Ohio-8332</extracted-citation> at \u00b6 7 ; <em>Branham</em> , 2d Dist.

The Second District has interpreted that requirement to be part of the trial court\'s duty under Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) to advise the defendant of "the maximum penalty involved." <em>See</em> <em>Landgraf</em> , 2d Dist.

In arguing that the trial court need not inform a defendant of a potential consecutive prison term under R.C. 2929.141(A), appellant, the state of Ohio, bypasses the plain language of the statute and the rule and looks instead to this court\'s decision in <em>State v. Johnson</em> , <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/40/130/" index="40" case-ids="1415447">40 Ohio St.3d 130</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%201295" index="41">532 N.E.2d 1295</extracted-citation> (1988). In <em>Johnson</em> , we reasoned that neither the United States Constitution nor the Ohio Constitution requires a trial court to <a id="p771" href="#p771" data-label="771" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*771</a><a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>inform a defendant during his plea hearing of the maximum total of the sentences he faces or that the sentences can be imposed consecutively. <em>Id.</em> at 133, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%201295" index="42">532 N.E.2d 1295</extracted-citation>. Regarding Crim.R. 11, we said that "[i]t would seem to be beyond a reasonable interpretation to suggest that the rule refers cumulatively to the total of all sentences received for all charges which a criminal defendant may answer in a single proceeding." <em><extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%201295" index="43">Id.</extracted-citation></em> We concluded that because the trial court in <em>Johnson</em> explained to the defendant the individual maximum sentences possible, his guilty plea was proper. <em><extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%201295" index="44">Id.</extracted-citation></em></p>\n    <p id="p-28"><strong>{\u00b6 15}</strong> Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) has been amended since <em>Johnson</em> so that a single plea can now apply to multiple charges, <em>see</em> 83 Ohio St.3d xciii, cix (effective July 1, 1998). Nevertheless, the state argues that the rule\'s advisements still apply only to the "maximum penalty involved" for the crimes to which the defendant pleads guilty. We disagree.</p>\n    <p id="p-29"><strong>{\u00b6 16}</strong> First, what happened to the defendant in <em>Johnson</em> is a far cry from what happened to Bishop. Johnson was told of his potential sentences for each individual offense; the trial court just failed to tell Johnson the sentences for each offense could run consecutively. Here, the trial court told Bishop that he could receive a maximum sentence of 12 months for his fifth-degree-felony conviction. But the trial court did not tell Bishop that he was also subject to a separate consecutive 12-month sentence for his postrelease-control violation.</p>\n    <p id="p-30"><strong>{\u00b6 17}</strong> Second, and more importantly, we must look to the plain language of the statutes involved. R.C. 2929.141(A)(1) provides that "[u]pon the conviction of or plea of guilty to a felony by a person on post-release control at the time of the commission of the felony, the court may terminate the term of post-release control" and impose a consecutive prison term. Sentences imposed under R.C. 2929.141(A) cannot stand alone. The court may impose the sentence only upon a conviction for or plea of guilty to a new felony, making the sentence for committing a new felony while on postrelease control and that for the new felony itself inextricably intertwined. By any fair reading of Crim.R. 11(C)(2), the potential R.C. 2929.141(A) sentence was part of the "maximum penalty involved" in this case.</p>\n    <p id="p-31"><strong><em>B.

But once the notice of appeal was filed in this court, the trial court was divested of jurisdiction. We were confronted with a similar situation in <em>State v.

But because the lead opinion takes that path, I write to explain why I believe its dictum is misguided.</p>\n    <p id="p-51"><strong>{\u00b6 26}</strong> The Ohio Constitution vests the "judicial power of the state" in "a supreme court, courts of appeals, courts of common pleas and divisions thereof, and such other courts inferior to the supreme court as may from time to time be established by law." Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 1. While the language of our Constitution does not mirror the "cases" and "controversies" language of the United States Constitution, <em>see</em> United States Constitution, Article III, Section 2, it is generally understood that the grant of the judicial power requires that we decide only "actual controversies where the judgment can be carried into effect, and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter at issue in the <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>case before it," <em>Travis v.

When a case becomes moot, there is no longer a controversy for this court to decide.</p>\n    <p id="p-52"><strong>{\u00b6 27}</strong> We have recognized exceptions to this principle and have decided cases that were moot after having found that the issues presented were capable of repetition yet evading review. <em>See</em> <em>Adkins v. McFaul</em> , <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/76/350/#p350" index="69" case-ids="1749807">76 Ohio St.3d 350</extracted-citation>, 350-351, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=667%20N.E.2d%201171" index="70">667 N.E.2d 1171</extracted-citation> (1996). But there is no reason to believe that the issue in this case-plea-hearing requirements for defendants currently on postrelease control-will evade review. Nor does the fact that this case raises a question of public or great general interest militate against applying the mootness doctrine. By definition, many cases we accept on jurisdictional appeal involve questions of "public or great general interest pursuant to Article IV, Section 2(B)(2)(e) of the Ohio Constitution." S.Ct.Prac.R. 5.02(A)(3). But being of public or great general interest has never been considered sufficient to allow us to decide a jurisdictional appeal that has been rendered moot by subsequent events.</p>\n    <p id="p-53"><strong>{\u00b6 28}</strong> Despite the constitutional provision tying our authority to the judicial power, the justices joining the lead opinion apparently believe that different rules apply to appeals that come to us as certified conflicts. But like our review of jurisdictional appeals, our review of certified-conflict questions depends on the existence of a case. If a court of appeals finds that its judgment conflicts with that of another court, it certifies "the record of <em>the case</em> to the supreme court for review and <em>final determination</em> ." (Emphasis added.) Ohio Constitution, Article IV, Section 3 (B)(4); <em>see</em> S.Ct.Prac.R. 8.02(D). Unlike certified state-law questions from federal court, which we answer without deciding the underlying case, we decide certified-conflict cases and enter judgment. If a case becomes moot, there is no controversy for us to decide and we should dismiss it.</p>\n    <p id="p-54"><strong>{\u00b6 29}</strong> But all of this discussion is unnecessarily advisory.

Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) requires a trial court accepting a guilty "plea" from a defendant to ensure that the defendant understands the "charges" and the "maximum penalty involved."

A "charge" is "[a] formal accusation of an offense as a preliminary step to prosecution." <em>Id.</em> at 282. The term "maximum penalty" refers to "[t]he heaviest punishment permitted by law." <em>Id.</em> at 1314.</p>\n    <p id="p-81"><strong>{\u00b6 42}</strong> Accordingly, the plea is the defendant\'s response to a charge filed alleging an offense, and the maximum penalty is the heaviest punishment prescribed by statute for that offense.

R.C. 2967.01(N). The parole board has authority to impose "conditions of release under a post-release control sanction that the board or court considers appropriate, and the conditions of release may include [a] community residential sanction, community nonresidential sanction, or financial sanction."

R.C. 2967.28(F)(1). If the Adult Parole Authority determines that an offender has violated a condition of postrelease control, it may impose a more restrictive condition (but not a residential sanction that includes a prison term) or it may refer the matter for a hearing before the parole board, which has the authority to impose a prison term for a postrelease-control violation. R.C. 2967.28(F)(2) and (3). Importantly, courts are not involved in determining whether a violation occurred or what the sanction should be. The sanction, even if a prison term, is administratively imposed.</p>\n    <p id="p-94"><strong>{\u00b6 52}</strong> However, if an offender violates the terms of postrelease control by committing a new felony, upon the conviction or plea of guilty for that offense, the court <em>may</em> terminate postrelease control and impose either community-control sanctions or a prison term for the postrelease-control violation for the greater of 12 months or the time remaining to be served on postrelease control. R.C. 2929.141(A). <em>If</em> a prison term is imposed, it is to be served consecutively to the sentence for the new felony but must be reduced by any prison term administratively imposed by the parole board.

We explained that "the General Assembly has indicated its clear intent that the prison term imposed for the violation of postrelease control is a reinstatement of part of the original sentence for violating the conditions of supervision, and is not meant to be a separate criminal punishment." <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 19. We continued: "[J]eopardy does not attach when a defendant receives a term of incarceration for the violation of conditions of postrelease control. Such a term of incarceration is attributable to the original sentence and is not a \'criminal punishment\' for Double Jeopardy Clause purposes * * *." <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 26.</p>\n    <p id="p-99"><strong>{\u00b6 56}</strong> Accordingly, as the statutory scheme demonstrates, a violation of the terms of postrelease control is not separately charged when the accused commits a new felony, and it is not part of the charge resolved by the accused\'s guilty plea resolving the new felony charged in the case. Nor is any sanction imposed for the postrelease-control violation part of the "maximum penalty involved," because it is not part of a new sentence that may be imposed for a new felony but, rather, is part of the original sentence that imposed postrelease control.</p>\n    <p id="p-100"><strong>{\u00b6 57}</strong> Nonetheless, the lead opinion reasons that a prison term imposed pursuant to R.C. 2929.141(A) "cannot stand alone" and is "inextricably intertwined" with the sentence imposed for the new felony that constitutes the postrelease-control violation. Lead opinion at \u00b6 17. It is unclear whether the justices joining the lead opinion view the postrelease-control violation as a "charge" or whether they view the judicial sanction imposed as part of the maximum penalty involved. But either way, the lead opinion\'s analysis cannot be squared with the language of the postrelease-control statute or our decisions recognizing that a sanction for a postrelease-control violation is not punishment for the commission of a new offense. It is true that the postrelease-control violation is connected to the new felony, but that is only because the guilty plea or conviction is the form of proof that the General Assembly has specified for showing that an offender violated the terms of his or her postrelease control by committing a felony. Standing alone, that does not make the violation any part of the charge resolved by the plea or make the sanction any part of the punishment for the conviction.</p>\n    <p id="p-101"><strong>{\u00b6 58}</strong> And as the lead opinion notes, at the time of the plea, there was only a "potential R.C. 2929.141(A) sentence." <em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 17. This language implies that a Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) advisement is required for any "possible" or "potential" sanction that may be imposed as a collateral consequence of pleading guilty to a <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>felony. But as we recognized in <em>Johnson</em> , Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) simply does not impose any duty on the trial court to inform the accused about its sentencing discretion. <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/40/130/" index="103" case-ids="1415447">40 Ohio St.3d at 134</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%201295" index="104">532 N.E.2d 1295</extracted-citation>. Rather, calculating potential sentences and informing the accused of the collateral consequences of a conviction are matters within the purview of legal representation. It is incumbent on defense counsel to know that the client committed a felony while on postrelease control, and an accused\'s guilty plea to an offense without knowing the legal consequences that may result might raise an issue of ineffective assistance of counsel but is not invalid.</p>\n    <p id="p-102"><strong>{\u00b6 59}</strong> Lastly, the lead opinion fails to appreciate the logical consequences of this court\'s judgment today. Its reasoning applies equally to an offender who violates community-control sanctions by committing a new offense. Although Crim.R. 11(C)(2) does not apply to community-control revocation proceedings, <em>e.g.</em> , <a id="p780" href="#p780" data-label="780" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*780</a><em>State v.

(citing cases), the possible imposition of a sentence for an offender\'s violation of the terms of his or her probation is "inextricably intertwined" with the commission of the new offense that constitutes the probation violation. Following the lead opinion\'s logic, the trial court\'s failure to advise the defendant that a probation violation could result in the imposition of a sentence served consecutively to the sentence for the new offense would likewise be a complete failure to comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), invalidating the plea. <em>See generally</em> R.C. 2929.25(A)(3)(c) ; <em>State v.

According to the lead opinion, an accused\'s plea is not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary if he or she is not informed that the trial court can impose a prison term for a violation of the terms of postrelease control when the accused pleads guilty to a felony that also constitutes the violation. Such a plea is presumed invalid, and no showing of prejudice is needed; that is, it is void.</p>\n    <p id="p-105"><strong>{\u00b6 62}</strong> However, during the plea hearing, the trial court generally will not know that an offender was on postrelease control at the time of the offense unless the offender or defense counsel volunteers that information; for example, that fact does not appear in this record until the filing of the presentence-investigation report. But if the court does not know that the R.C. 2929.141(A) judicial sanction is in play, it has no reason to give the advisement required by this court\'s judgment today. The <a id="p781" href="#p781" data-label="781" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*781</a>court\'s judgment therefore brings the validity of countless guilty pleas into question, regardless of whether the accused was prejudiced by any error. It also gives defendants a perverse incentive to conceal the fact that they were on postrelease control when they committed their new offense so that they may "wait and see" what sentence is imposed and then raise the issue like a rabbit from the hat in the court of appeals. Our decisions should not countenance such gamesmanship, but this court\'s judgment today makes that a winning strategy.</p>\n    <p id="p-106"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-107"><strong>{\u00b6 63}</strong> The General Assembly has enacted a clear-cut statutory scheme of supervision of offenders reentering society after a term of incarceration. It made policy choices by providing that a violation of postrelease control is not a crime and by granting trial courts discretion in deciding whether to impose a prison term as a sanction for that violation. Rather than second-guessing these policy choices in the guise of interpreting a court rule, we should leave the policymaking to the General Assembly, the sole arbiter of public policy.</p>\n    <p id="p-108"><strong>{\u00b6 64}</strong> Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) advisements were never intended for nonexistent criminal offenses that cannot be charged or for a potential penalty that cannot be known at the time of a plea. Rather, the trial court\'s duty in accepting a guilty <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>plea is to ensure that the accused understands the nature of the charges to be resolved by the plea and the maximum penalty that may be imposed on each of those charges. Because a violation of the terms of postrelease control is not a new charge and because the judicial sanction imposed for the violation is not a punishment imposed on the guilty plea to an offense, Bishop\'s plea hearing complied with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a).</p>\n    <p id="p-109"><strong>{\u00b6 65}</strong> For these reasons, I would answer the certified question in the negative and reverse the judgment of the Second District Court of Appeals.</p>\n  </opinion>\n  <opinion type="dissent">\n    <author id="p-110">Fischer, J., dissenting.</author>\n    <p id="p-111"><strong>{\u00b6 66}</strong> I respectfully dissent. When a defendant pleads guilty to a new felony offense while on postrelease control for a prior felony, Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) does not require a trial court to advise that defendant at the plea hearing for the new felony offense of the court\'s sentencing discretion under R.C. 2929.141(A) to terminate the defendant\'s existing postrelease control and impose a consecutive prison sentence for the postrelease-control violation.</p>\n    <p id="p-112"><strong>I. This case is not moot</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-113"><strong>{\u00b6 67}</strong> As the lead opinion notes, there is nothing in the record before this court to show that after the court of appeals\' remand of the case, appellee, Dustin Bishop, entered a new guilty plea to possession of heroin and that the trial court accepted this new guilty plea and resentenced him. Because the record before us indicates that there is a live controversy, this case is not moot.</p>\n    <p id="p-114"><strong>{\u00b6 68}</strong> Moreover, despite the analysis set forth in the lead opinion and as the opinion concurring in judgment only explains, we need not consider this court\'s ability to address moot questions of law; even if the trial court had accepted a guilty plea and resentenced Bishop pursuant to the appellate court\'s remand of the case, our precedent is clear that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to do so. <em>See</em> <em>State v.

Therefore, a defendant\'s punishment for violating the terms of postrelease control, a part of the defendant\'s prior sentence, cannot be considered a part of "the maximum penalty involved" for the criminal offense to which the current plea is entered.</p>\n    <p id="p-125"><strong>{\u00b6 76}</strong> This conclusion is supported by the language of R.C. 2929.141(A). That statute specifically provides that "[u]pon * * * [a] plea of guilty to a felony by a person on post-release control at the time of the commission of the felony, the court may terminate the term of post-release control, and the court may * * * impose a prison term <em>for the post-release control violation</em> ." (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2929.141(A)(1). The General Assembly made it clear that the judicial sanction permitted under R.C. 2929.141(A) is <em>not</em> imposed for the offense but may be imposed for the violation of the terms of the defendant\'s existing postrelease control. It is our duty to give effect to the words used in the statute, not to insert or delete words. <em>Cline v. Bur. of Motor Vehicles</em> , <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/61/93/#p97" index="151" case-ids="1708874">61 Ohio St.3d 93</extracted-citation>, 97, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20N.E.2d%2077" index="152">573 N.E.2d 77</extracted-citation> (1991). Thus, pursuant to the plain language of R.C. 2929.141(A), the penalty for violating the terms of postrelease control cannot also be considered "the maximum penalty involved" for the new offense to which the plea is entered.</p>\n    <p id="p-126"><strong>{\u00b6 77}</strong> The lead opinion would expand this court\'s interpretation of "the maximum penalty involved" to include a judicial sanction that may be imposed for the defendant\'s violation of the terms of his or her existing postrelease control by committing a felony offense. That conclusion is reached by relying on the proposition that "the sentence for committing a new felony while on postrelease control and that for the new felony itself [are] inextricably intertwined." Lead opinion at \u00b6 17. The trial court\'s discretionary sentencing authority should have no bearing on this court\'s interpretation of Crim.R. 11(C), which governs strictly what occurs at a plea hearing. The implicit definition of "the maximum penalty involved" that is found in Crim.R. 11(C) has not changed since we decided <em>Johnson</em> , and as we stated in that case, Crim.R. 11(C) "has no relevance to the exercise of the trial court\'s sentencing discretion at [the plea hearing] other than directing the court to proceed with or impose sentencing," <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/40/130/" index="153" case-ids="1415447">40 Ohio St.3d at 134</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%201295" index="154">532 N.E.2d 1295</extracted-citation>. The effect of the lead opinion would be to make "the maximum <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>penalty involved" include the speculative consequences of the plea in addition to the penalty for the charged offense to which the defendant is pleading guilty. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.141(A)(1), the trial court may "impose a prison term for the post-release control violation" that "shall be the greater of twelve months or the period of post-release control for the earlier felony minus any time the person has spent under the post-release control for the earlier felony." The trial court, without knowing the terms of the defendant\'s prior felony sentence, specifically the terms of the defendant\'s existing postrelease control, will not be able to inform the defendant of "the maximum penalty involved." At best, under the lead opinion\'s interpretation <a id="p784" href="#p784" data-label="784" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*784</a>of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), the trial court would be able to inform the defendant of an indeterminate range-from one year to a period of time that is equal to the time left on the defendant\'s postrelease-control term, whatever that might be-that the court may impose, at its discretion, that could be added to the defendant\'s sentence for the postrelease-control violation. The lead opinion would add confusion to "the maximum penalty involved" and would leave the defendant to speculate as to "the maximum penalty" that he or she would receive for pleading guilty to the felony offense. Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), the statutes governing postrelease control, and our caselaw simply do not support the lead opinion\'s conclusion in this case.</p>\n    <p id="p-127"><strong>{\u00b6 78}</strong> In order for the trial court to accept a guilty plea to a charge of possession of heroin in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), the court must inform the defendant of "the maximum penalty involved" when a defendant is convicted of possession of heroin. The following exchange occurred at Bishop\'s plea hearing:</p>\n    <blockquote id="p-128">THE COURT: The charge you\'re pleading guilty to is classified as a felony of the fifth degree. With that classification, the maximum penalty in terms of incarceration is 12 months in prison.

Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) did not require that the court inform Bishop of its discretionary authority under R.C. 2929.141(A) to sentence him to a consecutive <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>term of incarceration for violating the terms of the postrelease control that was imposed as a part of his prior felony conviction.</p>\n    <p id="p-134"><strong>III.

Bishop argues that Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) requires that advisement as a part of "the maximum penalty involved" and that the trial court\'s failure to follow Crim.R. 11 violated his federal due-process rights. As explained above, Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) does not require such an advisement; therefore, the trial court did not violate Bishop\'s due-process rights when it did not advise him of its R.C. 2929.141(A) authority.</p>\n    <p id="p-138"><strong>{\u00b6 83}</strong> The parties did <em>not</em> raise on appeal whether any statute, constitutional guarantee, or rule other than Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a) independently requires that a defendant pleading guilty to a felony be informed at his or her initial sentencing hearing or in the sentencing entry in which the trial court imposes his or her postrelease control of the trial court\'s ability to later revoke that postrelease control and impose a consecutive prison term when the defendant is convicted of or pleads guilty to a new felony offense. Nor did the parties raise whether any other rule, statute, or constitutional guarantee requires that the defendant be provided such information at any other time.</p>\n    <p id="p-139"><strong>{\u00b6 84}</strong> A defendant is not foreclosed from raising other arguments-statutory, rule-based, or constitutional-to attack the validity of a judicial sanction imposed <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>pursuant to R.C. 2929.141(A) when that defendant feels that the information provided prior to the judicial sanction being imposed was insufficient. In my opinion, however, a defendant cannot successfully base such a challenge on the language of Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), which is the only issue at bar.</p>\n    <p id="p-140"><strong>IV.

The lead opinion does not include an explanation of what would happen when the court is not aware of the defendant\'s existing postrelease control. In many cases, the judicial sanction will not be imposed by the judge that sentenced the defendant to postrelease control in that defendant\'s prior felony case; indeed, the prior felony conviction may not even have been entered in the same jurisdiction. <em>See</em> <em>State v. Hicks</em> , 5th Dist. Delaware No. 09CAA090088, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-2985" index="161">2010-Ohio-2985</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation url="https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202595153" index="162">2010 WL 2595153</extracted-citation>, \u00b6 9 ; <em>State v.

Thus, to comply with the requirement proposed in the lead opinion, the trial court would need to inform the defendant of the maximum penalty involved, but the trial court would have to know not only that the defendant was serving a period of postrelease control but also know the details of the underlying felony conviction <a id="p786" href="#p786" data-label="786" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*786</a>and of the defendant\'s existing postrelease-control term.</p>\n    <p id="p-144"><strong>{\u00b6 88}</strong> This would place an unreasonable burden on the trial court to be aware of every defendant\'s existing postrelease control. The trial court is often not made aware of the defendant\'s existing postrelease control and prior felony convictions until after the plea hearing through a presentence-investigation report. <em>See</em> R.C. 2951.03 ; Crim.R. 32.2. Would trial courts now be required to do their own investigation prior to a guilty plea? Would prosecuting attorneys now be required to provide the trial court with the defendant\'s rap sheet prior to the plea? Or would it be the defendant\'s burden to provide such information, as the defendant is likely the only individual to know whether or not he or she is on postrelease <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>control? If it would be the defendant\'s burden to inform the trial court, then any error by the trial court would have been invited by the defendant. And what would happen if a defendant pleaded guilty at arraignment? Would trial courts be required to delay such a plea in order to conduct such an investigation?</p>\n    <p id="p-145"><strong>{\u00b6 89}</strong> Further, the practical reality of the position taken by the lead opinion is that it might allow for the potential abuse of our plea system. When a defendant, who is likely in the best position to inform the trial court that he or she is serving a period of postrelease control, fails to provide that information to the trial court, the court will not provide notice of "the maximum penalty involved." Moreover, if the defendant waives a presentence-investigation report, <em>see</em> R.C. 2951.03(A)(1), then that court might not revoke the defendant\'s postrelease control at sentencing at all. The practical implication of this court adopting the lead opinion\'s conclusion would be that the defendant then could successfully argue that his plea was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made simply based on an error that the defendant had invited. And the defendant would not be required to show prejudice because "the trial court completely failed to inform [the defendant] that a consecutive prison sentence under R.C. 2929.141(A) was possible," lead opinion at \u00b6 20, even though the lengthier sentence was not realistically possible because the trial court could not impose the lengthier sentence without having the information that the defendant withheld from the trial court. In that scenario, a defendant who had suffered no prejudice would get another bite at the apple simply because <em>that defendant</em> failed to provide to the trial court information related to the defendant\'s existing postrelease control.</p>\n    <p id="p-146"><strong>{\u00b6 90}</strong> The conclusion of the lead opinion would likely place an unreasonable burden on the trial court and might provide defendants who are on postrelease control with the opportunity to abuse the plea system.</p>\n    <p id="p-147"><strong>V. Conclusion</strong></p>\n    <p id="p-148"><strong>{\u00b6 91}</strong> I would reverse the judgment of the Second District Court of Appeals and hold that pursuant to Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(a), a trial court does not need to advise a criminal defendant on postrelease control for a prior felony, during a plea hearing in a new felony case, of the trial court\'s ability under R.C. 2929.141(A) to terminate the defendant\'s existing postrelease control and impose a consecutive prison sentence for the postrelease-control violation.

Levy, the appellant, was the principal stockholder in the Studebaker Sales Company of Chicago. In January, 1926, David Gordon purchased the land involved in this foreclosure, from that company. He paid $35,000, in cash, and secured the balance of $100,000 by a mortgage. He reduced the debt to $70,000, and on April 13, 1931, when this became due, an agreement was made between Gordon and Levy by which $5000 more was paid and the property was deeded to the Broadway-Carmen Building Corporation, organized by Gordon. That company gave its note for $65,000, guaranteed by Gordon and his wife, and secured by a trust deed on the premises. In addition, Levy received a commission of \" $1950. After $2500 had been paid on the principal debt, default was made by the mortgagor, and Levy obtained a judgment at law against David Gordon and Ida Gordon, his wife, for $66,691.87. He also brought this suit to foreclose the trust deed. The superior court of Cook county rendered a decree on May 26, 1933) and found that $70,246.91 was due Levy on March 15, 1933. It ordered the mortgaged premises sold at public auction and directed the master in chancery to carry out the decree. Accordingly the master, on June 21, 1933, struck off the property to appellant, Levy, for $50,000. The appellee filed objections to the report of sale. It claimed that the property was reasonably worth $80,000, but that economic conditions had resulted in the destruction of the market for real estate in Chicago. It prayed that the court establish the value of the premises and credit that value on the amount found due Levy; that a deficiency judgment be denied and that the judgment previously rendered against Gordon and wife, be satisfied in full. It stated that it had offered, and was then willing, to deed the property to the appellant in cancellation of the debt. Levy answered, denying that the premises were worth more than $50,000. He set up the fact that the property was being managed by a receiver and that the rental was $150 per month, plus $5 for each automobile sold by the lessee; that the 1929, 1930 and 1931 taxes, totalling $6000, were unpaid. He offered to assign his certificate of purchase to anyone for the amount of his bid. The mortgaged premises are located at a street intersection and are known as No. 5100 Broadway. The lot is 97 by 100 feet and is improved with a one-story automobile display building and service garage. Both parties introduced affidavits as to value. Those on behalf of appellee, set the value at $77,400 to $80,000, which was based on a rental value of $400 per month, and a possible rental of $500 if the building were divided into storerooms. The affidavits on behalf of appellant showed that the improvements cost $35,902 thirteen years before, and that their replacement value was $22,500. They showed the reasonable rental value to be $250 per month and fixed the value of the premises at from $40,000 to $50,000. At the close of the hearing on the objections, the chancellor ordered that the sale be approved, provided the appellant released and cancelled the outstanding judgment against the Gordons, and the mortgage indebtedness, but Levy refused to do this. A decree was entered on January 20, 1934, denying confirmation of the master’s report of sale. It ordered a re-sale of the property at an upset price of $71,508.45, the amount then due, together with interest and costs of suit. The Appellate Court for the First District affirmed this decree on appeal. We granted leave and the cause is here on appeal.</p> <p id=\"b282-3\" pgmap=\"282\">Appellant contends that the order of January 20, 1934, denying confirmation of the master’s report and directing a new sale at an upset price, was an amendment to the foreclosure decree dated May 26, 1933, and that the later decree was of no effect, because'it was rendered at a succeeding term. This contention cannot be upheld. It was the duty of the court to supervise the sale and to approve or reject the report. If rejected, it was the duty of the court to order a re-sale and directions as to time, place and terms of sale were but incidents to such order. Mariner v. Ingraham, 230 Ill. 130; L. R A. 1915A, 699.</p> <p id=\"b282-4\" pgmap=\"282(145) 283(382) 284(21)\">As stated by appellant the remaining points for consideration are embodied in the question: May the chancellor, in a suit to foreclose a real estate mortgage, require the plaintiff to waive his right to a deficiency decree as a condition precedent to confirming the master’s report of sale, or, in the alternative, may the chancellor fix a value ■ and direct the master not to accept a bid lower than this reserved or upset price? Appellant says a court of equity is without power to disapprove a master’s report of sale in a foreclosure suit, except there be mistake, fraud or some violation of duty by the purchaser or the master. He says that no matter how grossly inadequate the bid may be, it does not constitute fraud, or warrant the chancellor in disapproving the sale. No argument is required to disclose or sustain the wisdom of the rule that public policy and the interest of debtors require stability in judicial sales and that these sales should not be disturbed without cause. However, it is to be observed that the rule requiring more than mere inadequacy of price, and the showing of a breach of duty by the purchaser or the officer, or a fraud upon the debtor, arose out of cases where the judicial sales had been consummated and not out of mere offers to buy from a court. For example in Skakel v. Cycle Trade Publishing Co. 237 Ill. 482, the complainant brought his action to set aside a sheriff’s sale and a deed already executed. The cases of Mixer v. Sibley, 53 Ill. 61, Davis v. Pickett, 72 id. 483, O’Callaghan v. O’Callaghan, 91 id. 228, and Smith v. Huntoon, 134 id. 24, all involved sales under executions at law. Dobbins v. Wilson, 107 Ill. 17, concerned a deed issued following a United States marshal’s sale. Quigley v. Breckenridge, 180 Ill. 627, involved a sale made pursuant to a decree for partition, and although we held that the sale was fair and the master’s report.of sale should have been approved, nevertheless we re-affirmed the doctrine that a court of chancery possesses a large discretion in passing upon masters’ reports of sale. In that case we pointed out the fact that such a sale is not completed until it is confirmed, and that until then, it confers no right in the land upon the purchaser. The sale in Bondurant v. Bondurant, 251 Ill. 324, was made by a trustee who had power to sell the land at public vendue and was not a judicial sale in the legal sense. In the case of Allen v. Shepard, 87 Ill. 314, we exercised our judicial power to determine whether or not the bid made at an administrator’s sale was adequate, and determined that it was. In Clegg v. Christensen, 346 Ill. 314, we again exercised the same power. Abbott v. Beebe, 226 Ill. 417, concerned a partition sale. The land brought more than two-thirds of the appraised value. We again declared that there was power in the chancellor to set aside a judicial sale for inadequacy of price but we held that the- facts showed the sale under consideration was fairly made. The record did not disclose any inadequacy in the price.</p> <p id=\"b284-3\" pgmap=\"284\">In sales by conservators, guardians and trustees, involving consideration of objections filed before reports of sale were approved, inadequacy of price has always been considered in determining whether the sale was fairly made and whether the report should be approved and confirmed. In most of the cases the objector tendered a larger bid and very often the bid was required to be secured, but the fact that there ,was such an increased bid was, at most, evidence that the sale price was inadequate. In Kloepping v. Stellmacher, 21 N. J. Eq. 328, a sheriff sold property worth $2000 for $52. The owner was ignorant, stupid and perverse, and would not believe his property would be sold for so trifling an amount, although he had been forewarned. Redemption was allowed upon payment of the purchase price and costs. The court said: “But when such gross inadequacy is combined with fraud or mistake, or any other ground of relief in equity, it will incline the court strongly to afford relief. The sale in this case is a great oppression on the complainants. They are ignorant, stupid, perverse and poor. They lose by it all their property, and are ill fitted to acquire more. They are such as this court should incline to protect, notwithstanding perverseness.”</p> <p id=\"b284-4\" pgmap=\"284(111) 285(146)\">In Graffam v. Burgess, 117 U. S. 180, 29 L. ed. 839, the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley, said: “It was formerly the rule in England, in chancery sales, that until confirmation of the master’s report, the bidding would be opened upon a mere offer to advance the price 10 per centum. (2 Daniell, Ch. Pr. 1st ed. 924; 2d ed. by Perkins, 1465, 1467; Sugden, V. &amp; P. 14th ed. 114.) But Lord Eldon expressed much dissatisfaction with this practice of opening biddings upon a mere offer of an advanced price, as tending to diminish confidence in such sales, to keep bidders from attending, and to diminish the amount realized. (White v. Wilson, 14 Ves. 151; Williams v. Attleborough, Tur. &amp; Rus. 76; White v. Damon, 7 Ves. 34.) Lord Eldon’s views were finally adopted in England in the Sale of Land by Auction act, 1857, (30 and 31 Victoria, chap. 48, sec. 7,) so that now the highest bidder at a sale by auction of land, under an order of the court, provided he has'bid a sum equal to or higher than the reserved price (if any), will be declared and allowed the purchaser, unless the court or judge, on the ground of fraud or improper conduct in the management of the sale, upon the application of any person interested in the land, either opens the bidding or orders the property to be resold. 1 Sugden, V. &amp; P. 14th ed. by Perkins, 14 note (a).</p> <p id=\"b285-3\" pgmap=\"285\">“In this country Lord Eldon’s views were adopted at an early day by the courts; and the rule has become almost universal that a sale will not be set aside for inadequacy of price unless the inadequacy be so great as to shock the conscience, or unless there be additional circumstances against its fairness; being very much the rule that always prevailed in England as to setting aside sales after the master’s report had been confirmed. [Citing many cases.]</p> <p id=\"b285-4\" pgmap=\"285\">“From the cases here cited we may draw the general conclusion that if the inadequacy of price is so gross as to shock the conscience, or if in addition to gross inadequacy, the purchaser has been guilty of any unfairness, or has taken any undue advantage, or if the owner of the property, or party interested in it, has been for any other reason, misled or surprised, then the sale will be regarded as fraudulent and void, or the party injured will be permitted to redeem the property sold. Great inadequacy requires only slight circumstances of unfairness in the conduct of the party benefited by the sale to raise the presumption of fraud.”</p> <p id=\"b285-5\" pgmap=\"285(22) 286(22)\">In Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, 145 U. S. 349, 36 L. ed. 732, Mr. Justice Brewer said, at page 367: “Indeed even before confirmation the sale would not be set aside for mere inadequacy, unless so great as to shock the conscience.”</p> <p id=\"b286-3\" pgmap=\"286\">Stability must be given to judicial sales which have reached the point where title has vested in the purchaser, otherwise bidding would be discouraged. But where a bidder does not become vested with any interest in the land but has only made an offer to buy, subject to the approval of his offer by the court, and he bids with that condition, there can be no good reason why bidding would be discouraged by reason of the court’s power to approve or disapprove the sale for gross inadequacy of bid. Sales by masters are not sales in a legal sense, until they are confirmed. Until then, they are sales only in a popular sense. The accepted bidder acquires no independent right to'have his purchase completed, but remains only a preferred proposer until confirmation of the sale by the court, as agreed to by its ministerial agent. Confirmation is final consent, and the court, being in fact the vendor, may consent or not, in its discretion. (Hart v. Burch, 130 Ill. 426; Jennings v. Dunphy, 174 id. 86; Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, supra; Smith v. Arnold, 5 Mason, 414.) In the case last •cited, Mr. Justice Story said, at page 420: “In sales directed by the court of chancery, the whole business is transacted by a public officer, under the guidance and superintendence of the court itself. Even after the sale is made, it is not final until a report is made to the court and it is approved and confirmed.”</p> <p id=\"b286-4\" pgmap=\"286(86) 287(251)\">Many of the decisions, relied upon and cited by appel- . lant, arose out of sales of lands under mortgages or trust deeds which contained a power of sale and were made at a time when there was no redemption, unless it was provided for in the mortgage or trust deed. Such sales were not subject to approval or disapproval by courts and the only remedy the mortgagor had against fraud or other misconduct was by a bill in equity to set aside the conveyanee, or for redemption. In 1843 the legislature passed an act regulating the foreclosure of mortgages on real property which created a redemption period in favor of mortgagors, but the act did not purport to govern trust deeds containing a power of sale. Thereafter the foreclosing of mortgages was committed to courts of chancery, under their general equity powers, except as to certain prescribed matters of procedure. From that time mortgage foreclosure sales were made by an officer who was required to report the sale to the court. Purchasers did not become vested with any interest in the land sold until the report of sale was approved. The court fixed the terms and conditions of foreclosure sales and this practice still continues. In 1879 the legislature provided that no real estate should be sold by virtue of any power of sale contained in any mortgage, trust deed, or other conveyance in the nature of a mortgage, but that thereafter such real estate should be sold in the same manner provided for foreclosure of mortgages containing no power of sale, and then only in pursuance of a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. (State Bar Stat. 1935, chap. 95, par. 24; 95 S. H. A. 23.) The history of this legislation is conclusive proof that it was the legislative intent that foreclosure sales should be made only upon such terms and conditions as were approved by the courts. Garrett v. Moss, 20 Ill. 549.</p> <p id=\"b287-3\" pgmap=\"287(103) 288(66)\">Unfairness from any cause which operates to the prejudice of an interested party, will abundantly justify a chancery court in refusing to approve a sale. We said in Roberts v. Goodin, 288 Ill. 561: “The setting aside of the sale and ordering the property re-sold was a matter which rested largely within the discretion of the chancellor, whose duty it was to see that the lien be enforced with the least damage possible to the property rights of the mortgagor. Counsel cite numerous cases touching their contention that the chancellor erred in setting aside this sale. The cases cited, however, arose after the sale had once been confirmed, and not where, as here, the objection to the confirmation of the sale was filed immediately after the sale and before any confirmation had taken place. The chancellor has a broad discretion in the matter of approving or disapproving a master’s sale made subject to the court’s approval by the terms of the decree.”</p> <p id=\"b288-3\" pgmap=\"288\">The legislature’s purpose would be defeated if any other interpretation were given to the statutes on the subject of mortgage foreclosure. It is unusual for land to bring its full, fair market value at a forced sale. While courts can not guarantee that mortgaged property will bring its full value, they can prevent unwarranted sacrifice of a debtor’s property. Mortgage creditors resort to courts of equity for relief and those courts prescribe equitable terms upon which they may receive that relief, and it is within their power to prevent creditors from taking undue and unconscionable advantage of debtors, under the guise of collecting a debt. A slight inadequacy is not sufficient reason to disapprove a master’s sale, but where the amount bid is so grossly inadequate that it shocks the conscience of a court of equity, it is the chancellor’s duty to disapprove the report of sale. Connely v. Rue, 148 Ill. 207; Kiebel v. Reick, 216 id. 474; Wilson v. Ford, 190 id. 614; Ballentyne v. Smith, 205 U. S. 285, 51 L. ed. 803.</p> <p id=\"b288-4\" pgmap=\"288(113) 289(137)\">The case of Slack v. Cooper, 219 Ill. 138, illustrates the rule. In that case the master sold the land, upon which the mortgage had been foreclosed, to the solicitor for the mortgagor for $3000. He acted under the mistaken impression that the buyer was the solicitor for the mortgagee, who appeared shortly thereafter and bid $7000. The master then announced publicly that since no cash had been deposited by the original bidder, and because of the misapprehension stated and his haste in making the sale, it would be re-opened for higher and better bids. At page 144 of that decision we said: “If the chancellor finds upon the coming in of the report of a master, that the sale as made is not to the best interest of all concerned and is inequitable, or that any fraud or misconduct has been practiced upon the master or the court or any irregularities in the proceedings, it is his duty to set aside the sale as made and order another sale of the premises. The chancellor has a broad discretion in passing upon the acts of the master and approving or disapproving his acts in reference to sales and entering his own decrees, (Quigley v. Breckenridge, 180 Ill. 627,) and his decree will not be disturbed by this court unless it is shown that he has abused his discretion and entered such an order or decree as would not seem equitable between the parties interested.”</p> <p id=\"b289-3\" pgmap=\"289\">We have limited our discussion to the power of a court of chancery to approve or disapprove a master’s report of sale in a foreclosure suit and we hold that the court has broad discretionary powers over such sales. Where it appears that the bid offered the court for the premises is so grossly inadequate that its acceptance amounts to a fraud, the court has the power to reject the bid and order a re-sale.</p> <p id=\"b289-4\" pgmap=\"289(159) 290(95)\">There is little or no difference between the equitable jurisdiction' and power in a chancery court to refuse approval to a report of sale on foreclosure, and the power to fix, in advance, a reserved or upset price, as a minimum at which the property may be sold. We have referred to the acts of 1843 and 1879 which require trust deeds and mortgages to be foreclosed in chancery courts and have pointed out that courts of equity, exercising their general equity powers in such cases, have the right to fix reasonable terms and conditions for the carrying out of the provisions of the foreclosure decree, and that such courts may order a new sale and set the old aside for the violation of some duty by the master, or for fraud or mistake. No reason appears why the chancellor cannot prevent a sale at a grossly inadequate price by fixing á reasonable sale price in advance. The same judicial power 'is involved in either action. What is necessary to be done in the end, to prevent fraud and injustice, may be forestalled by proper judicial action in the beginning. Such a course is not against the policy of the law in this State and it is not the equivalent of an appraisal statute. It is common practice in both the State and Federal courts to fix an upset price in mortgage foreclosure suits. This is in harmony with the accepted principles governing judicial power in mortgage foreclosures.</p> <p id=\"b290-3\" pgmap=\"290\">In First National Bank v. Bryn Mawr Beach Building Corp. 365 Ill. 409, we pointed out the fact that such property as was there under consideration seldom sells at anything like its reproduction cost, or even its fair cash market value, at a judicial sale. We recognized the fact that the equity powers of State courts are no more limited than those of Federal courts, and that equity jurisdiction over mortgage foreclosures is general rather than limited or statutory. In part we said: “It would seem that since equity courts have always exercised jurisdiction to decree the enforcement of mortgage liens and to supervise foreclosure sales, such jurisdiction need not expire merely because the questions or conditions surrounding the exercise of such time-honored functions are new or complicated. If it may reasonably be seen that the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court of equity beyond the sale of the property will result in better protection to parties before it, it would seem not only to be germane to matters of undisputed jurisdiction, but to make for the highest exercise of the court’s admitted functions.” We there held that a court of equity has jurisdiction, in connection with an application for approval of a foreclosure sale, to approve a re-organization plan submitted by a bondholders’ committee. The question is somewhat different from that presented in the case before us, but we there recognized the continuing vitality and growth of equity jurisprudence.</p> <p id=\"b291-2\" pgmap=\"291\">Cases wherein an upset price has been fixed are not confined to large properties for which, by reason of their great value, the market is limited or there is no market whatever. In McClintic-Marshall Co. v. Scandinavian-American Building Co. 296 Fed. 601, a building was constructed on two lots covered by the mortgage, and one lot belonging to the mortgagor that was not mortgaged. It was necessary, under the circumstances, to sell all the property, and to protect the mortgagor a reserved price was fixed. The fact of an upset price is referred to, although there was no objection to it being fixed, in Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, 228 U. S. 482, 57 L. ed. 931, and Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, supra, and the power has been exercised in numerous other cases. 104 A. L. R. 375; 90 id. 1321; 88 id. 1481.</p> <p id=\"b291-3\" pgmap=\"291\">The appellant did not raise constitutional objections in the trial court and by appealing to the Appellate Court for the First District he would waive such questions. However, the fixing of an upset price does not violate section 10 of article 1 of the Federal constitution nor section 14 of article 2 of the Illinois constitution, which inhibit the impairment of the obligation of contracts. The reserved price dealt only with the remedy, and it was within the court’s power to establish it as one of the terms and conditions of the sale. The appellant was not deprived of his right to enforce the contract, and his remedy was neither denied, nor so embarrassed, as to seriously impair the value of his contract or the right to enforce it. Penniman’s Case, 103 U. S. 714, 26 L. ed. 502; Town of Cheney’s Grove v. Van Scoyoc, 357 Ill. 52.</p> <p id=\"b291-4\" pgmap=\"291\">It is contended that the present holding conflicts with what we said in Chicago Title and Trust Co. v. Robin, 361 Ill. 261. It was not necessary to that decision to pass upon the power to fix an upset price, and what we said on that subject is not adhered to.</p> <p id=\"b292-2\" pgmap=\"292\">Each case must be based upon its own facts, and from this record we are of the opinion that no such gross inadequacy existed in the bid of $50,000, as would warrant the chancellor in refusing approval of the master’s sale. Although the rents were pledged in the trust deed, they would amount to but little more than the taxes on the property of approximately $2000 per annum. Appellee’s affidavits base the estimate of value largely on the rental value of the premises. They were rented for $150 per month, plus $5 for each automobile sold by the lessee, and this amounted to a total of $200 a month. Even if the premises brought $400, or the $500 per month which appellee’s witnesses said could be had if the property was divided into storerooms, the cost of these changes is not given. This testimony did not warrant the chancellor in finding that these premises were worth $80,000. Although the property had been sold, before the panic, for $135,000, the value of real estate was greater then than at the time of the master’s sale. The proof did not sustain a greater value than $50,000 at the time of the sale, but if it be assumed- that this was somewhat inadequate, the fact that there was a depressed market for real estate would not be a sufficient circumstance, coupled with the supposed inadequacy in the bid, to warrant the chancellor in disapproving the master’s report of sale. The power to disapprove a sale for gross inadequacy of bid exists independent of an economic depression. The chancellor abused his discretion and erred in refusing to approve the sale at $50,000.</p> <p id=\"b292-3\" pgmap=\"292\">The judgment of the Appellate Court and the decree of the superior court are reversed and the cause is remanded to the superior court of Cook county, with directions to approve the master’s report of sale.</p> <p id=\"b292-4\" pgmap=\"292\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p> </opinion> <opinion type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b292-5\" pgmap=\"292\">Stone and Shaw, JJ.,</author> <p id=\"ASY\" pgmap=\"292\">specially concurring:</p> <p id=\"b292-6\" pgmap=\"292\">We agree with the result reached but not in all that is said in the opinion.</p> </opinion> <opinion type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b293-2\" pgmap=\"293\">Mr. Chief Justice Herrick,</author> <p id=\"ADM\" pgmap=\"293\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b293-3\" pgmap=\"293\">I concur in the legal conclusion reached in the majority opinion that the chancellor had the power to fix an upset price for the sale of the property against which foreclosure was sought. He set the upset price on the re-sale order at $71,508.45. He found that the market value of the property was $80,000. The majority opinion shows that the hearing as to the value of the property was on affidavits. Those of appellant tended to establish a value of $40,000 to $50,000; those of appellee, from $77,400 to $80,000. The upset price established by the chancellor was clearly within the scope of the evidence. This court has consistently held on issues'involving the value of property, where the value was fixed by the verdict of a jury on conflicting evidence, that, in the absence of material error, this court would not disturb the finding of the jury where the amount determined was within the range of the evidence and not the result of passion and prejudice. (Department of Public Works v. Foreman Bank, 363 Ill. 13, 24.) In my opinion we should accord to the finding of the chancellor on the question of value the same credit we do to a verdict of a jury on that subject. The application of this rule to the instant cause would result in the affirmance of the decree. The judgment of the Appellate Court and the order of the superior court should each have been affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b293-4\" pgmap=\"293\">Mr. Justice Orr,</author> <p id=\"AU6\" pgmap=\"293\">also dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b293-5\" pgmap=\"293\">I disagree with that portion of the opinion holding that a court of chancery, in a foreclosure case, has inherent power to fix an upset price to be bid at the sale.

Levy, the appellant, was the principal stockholder in the Studebaker Sales Company of Chicago. In January, 1926, David Gordon purchased the land involved in this foreclosure, from that company. He paid $35,000, in cash, and secured the balance of $100,000 by a mortgage. He reduced the debt to $70,000, and on April 13, 1931, when this became due, an agreement was made between Gordon and Levy by which $5000 more was paid and the property was deeded to the Broadway-Carmen Building Corporation, organized by Gordon. That company gave its note for $65,000, guaranteed by Gordon and his wife, and secured by a trust deed on the premises. In addition, Levy received a commission of " $1950. After $2500 had been paid on the principal debt, default was made by the mortgagor, and Levy obtained a judgment at law against David Gordon and Ida Gordon, his wife, for $66,691.87. He also brought this suit to foreclose the trust deed. The superior court of Cook county rendered a decree on May 26, 1933) and found that $70,246.91 was due Levy on March 15, 1933. It ordered the mortgaged premises sold at public auction and directed the master in chancery to carry out the decree. Accordingly the master, on June 21, 1933, struck off the property to appellant, Levy, for $50,000. The appellee filed objections to the report of sale. It claimed that the property was reasonably worth $80,000, but that economic conditions had resulted in the destruction of the market for real estate in Chicago. It prayed that the court establish the value of the premises and credit that value on the amount found due Levy; that a deficiency judgment be denied and that the judgment previously rendered against Gordon and wife, be satisfied in full. It stated that it had offered, and was then willing, to deed the property to the appellant in cancellation of the debt. Levy answered, denying that the premises were worth more than $50,000. He set up the fact that the property was being managed by a receiver and that the rental was $150 per month, plus $5 for each automobile sold by the lessee; that the 1929, 1930 and 1931 taxes, totalling $6000, were unpaid. He offered to assign his certificate of purchase to anyone for the amount of his bid. The mortgaged premises are located at a street intersection and are known as No. 5100 Broadway. The lot is 97 by 100 feet and is improved with a one-story automobile display building and service garage. Both parties introduced affidavits as to value. Those on behalf of appellee, set the value at $77,400 to $80,000, which was based on a rental value of $400 per month, and a possible rental of $500 if the building were divided into storerooms. The affidavits on behalf of appellant showed that the improvements cost $35,902 thirteen years before, and that their replacement value was $22,500. They showed the reasonable rental value to be $250 per month and fixed the value of the premises at from $40,000 to $50,000. At the close of the hearing on the objections, the chancellor ordered that the sale be approved, provided the appellant released and cancelled the outstanding judgment against the Gordons, and the mortgage indebtedness, but Levy refused to do this. A decree was entered on January 20, 1934, denying confirmation of the master’s report of sale. It ordered a re-sale of the property at an upset price of $71,508.45, the amount then due, together with interest and costs of suit. The Appellate Court for the First District affirmed this decree on appeal. We granted leave and the cause is here on appeal.</p> <p id="b282-3" pgmap="282">Appellant contends that the order of January 20, 1934, denying confirmation of the master’s report and directing a new sale at an upset price, was an amendment to the foreclosure decree dated May 26, 1933, and that the later decree was of no effect, because\'it was rendered at a succeeding term. This contention cannot be upheld. It was the duty of the court to supervise the sale and to approve or reject the report. If rejected, it was the duty of the court to order a re-sale and directions as to time, place and terms of sale were but incidents to such order. Mariner v. Ingraham, 230 Ill. 130; L. R A. 1915A, 699.</p> <p id="b282-4" pgmap="282(145) 283(382) 284(21)">As stated by appellant the remaining points for consideration are embodied in the question: May the chancellor, in a suit to foreclose a real estate mortgage, require the plaintiff to waive his right to a deficiency decree as a condition precedent to confirming the master’s report of sale, or, in the alternative, may the chancellor fix a value ■ and direct the master not to accept a bid lower than this reserved or upset price? Appellant says a court of equity is without power to disapprove a master’s report of sale in a foreclosure suit, except there be mistake, fraud or some violation of duty by the purchaser or the master. He says that no matter how grossly inadequate the bid may be, it does not constitute fraud, or warrant the chancellor in disapproving the sale. No argument is required to disclose or sustain the wisdom of the rule that public policy and the interest of debtors require stability in judicial sales and that these sales should not be disturbed without cause. However, it is to be observed that the rule requiring more than mere inadequacy of price, and the showing of a breach of duty by the purchaser or the officer, or a fraud upon the debtor, arose out of cases where the judicial sales had been consummated and not out of mere offers to buy from a court. For example in Skakel v. Cycle Trade Publishing Co. 237 Ill. 482, the complainant brought his action to set aside a sheriff’s sale and a deed already executed. The cases of Mixer v. Sibley, 53 Ill. 61, Davis v. Pickett, 72 id. 483, O’Callaghan v. O’Callaghan, 91 id. 228, and Smith v. Huntoon, 134 id. 24, all involved sales under executions at law. Dobbins v. Wilson, 107 Ill. 17, concerned a deed issued following a United States marshal’s sale. Quigley v. Breckenridge, 180 Ill. 627, involved a sale made pursuant to a decree for partition, and although we held that the sale was fair and the master’s report.of sale should have been approved, nevertheless we re-affirmed the doctrine that a court of chancery possesses a large discretion in passing upon masters’ reports of sale. In that case we pointed out the fact that such a sale is not completed until it is confirmed, and that until then, it confers no right in the land upon the purchaser. The sale in Bondurant v. Bondurant, 251 Ill. 324, was made by a trustee who had power to sell the land at public vendue and was not a judicial sale in the legal sense. In the case of Allen v. Shepard, 87 Ill. 314, we exercised our judicial power to determine whether or not the bid made at an administrator’s sale was adequate, and determined that it was. In Clegg v. Christensen, 346 Ill. 314, we again exercised the same power. Abbott v. Beebe, 226 Ill. 417, concerned a partition sale. The land brought more than two-thirds of the appraised value. We again declared that there was power in the chancellor to set aside a judicial sale for inadequacy of price but we held that the- facts showed the sale under consideration was fairly made. The record did not disclose any inadequacy in the price.</p> <p id="b284-3" pgmap="284">In sales by conservators, guardians and trustees, involving consideration of objections filed before reports of sale were approved, inadequacy of price has always been considered in determining whether the sale was fairly made and whether the report should be approved and confirmed. In most of the cases the objector tendered a larger bid and very often the bid was required to be secured, but the fact that there ,was such an increased bid was, at most, evidence that the sale price was inadequate. In Kloepping v. Stellmacher, 21 N. J. Eq. 328, a sheriff sold property worth $2000 for $52. The owner was ignorant, stupid and perverse, and would not believe his property would be sold for so trifling an amount, although he had been forewarned. Redemption was allowed upon payment of the purchase price and costs. The court said: “But when such gross inadequacy is combined with fraud or mistake, or any other ground of relief in equity, it will incline the court strongly to afford relief. The sale in this case is a great oppression on the complainants. They are ignorant, stupid, perverse and poor. They lose by it all their property, and are ill fitted to acquire more. They are such as this court should incline to protect, notwithstanding perverseness.”</p> <p id="b284-4" pgmap="284(111) 285(146)">In Graffam v. Burgess, 117 U. S. 180, 29 L. ed. 839, the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking through Mr. Justice Bradley, said: “It was formerly the rule in England, in chancery sales, that until confirmation of the master’s report, the bidding would be opened upon a mere offer to advance the price 10 per centum. (2 Daniell, Ch. Pr. 1st ed. 924; 2d ed. by Perkins, 1465, 1467; Sugden, V. &amp; P. 14th ed. 114.) But Lord Eldon expressed much dissatisfaction with this practice of opening biddings upon a mere offer of an advanced price, as tending to diminish confidence in such sales, to keep bidders from attending, and to diminish the amount realized. (White v. Wilson, 14 Ves. 151; Williams v. Attleborough, Tur. &amp; Rus. 76; White v. Damon, 7 Ves. 34.) Lord Eldon’s views were finally adopted in England in the Sale of Land by Auction act, 1857, (30 and 31 Victoria, chap. 48, sec. 7,) so that now the highest bidder at a sale by auction of land, under an order of the court, provided he has\'bid a sum equal to or higher than the reserved price (if any), will be declared and allowed the purchaser, unless the court or judge, on the ground of fraud or improper conduct in the management of the sale, upon the application of any person interested in the land, either opens the bidding or orders the property to be resold. 1 Sugden, V. &amp; P. 14th ed. by Perkins, 14 note (a).</p> <p id="b285-3" pgmap="285">“In this country Lord Eldon’s views were adopted at an early day by the courts; and the rule has become almost universal that a sale will not be set aside for inadequacy of price unless the inadequacy be so great as to shock the conscience, or unless there be additional circumstances against its fairness; being very much the rule that always prevailed in England as to setting aside sales after the master’s report had been confirmed. [Citing many cases.]</p> <p id="b285-4" pgmap="285">“From the cases here cited we may draw the general conclusion that if the inadequacy of price is so gross as to shock the conscience, or if in addition to gross inadequacy, the purchaser has been guilty of any unfairness, or has taken any undue advantage, or if the owner of the property, or party interested in it, has been for any other reason, misled or surprised, then the sale will be regarded as fraudulent and void, or the party injured will be permitted to redeem the property sold. Great inadequacy requires only slight circumstances of unfairness in the conduct of the party benefited by the sale to raise the presumption of fraud.”</p> <p id="b285-5" pgmap="285(22) 286(22)">In Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, 145 U. S. 349, 36 L. ed. 732, Mr. Justice Brewer said, at page 367: “Indeed even before confirmation the sale would not be set aside for mere inadequacy, unless so great as to shock the conscience.”</p> <p id="b286-3" pgmap="286">Stability must be given to judicial sales which have reached the point where title has vested in the purchaser, otherwise bidding would be discouraged. But where a bidder does not become vested with any interest in the land but has only made an offer to buy, subject to the approval of his offer by the court, and he bids with that condition, there can be no good reason why bidding would be discouraged by reason of the court’s power to approve or disapprove the sale for gross inadequacy of bid. Sales by masters are not sales in a legal sense, until they are confirmed. Until then, they are sales only in a popular sense. The accepted bidder acquires no independent right to\'have his purchase completed, but remains only a preferred proposer until confirmation of the sale by the court, as agreed to by its ministerial agent. Confirmation is final consent, and the court, being in fact the vendor, may consent or not, in its discretion. (Hart v. Burch, 130 Ill. 426; Jennings v. Dunphy, 174 id. 86; Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, supra; Smith v. Arnold, 5 Mason, 414.) In the case last •cited, Mr. Justice Story said, at page 420: “In sales directed by the court of chancery, the whole business is transacted by a public officer, under the guidance and superintendence of the court itself. Even after the sale is made, it is not final until a report is made to the court and it is approved and confirmed.”</p> <p id="b286-4" pgmap="286(86) 287(251)">Many of the decisions, relied upon and cited by appel- . lant, arose out of sales of lands under mortgages or trust deeds which contained a power of sale and were made at a time when there was no redemption, unless it was provided for in the mortgage or trust deed. Such sales were not subject to approval or disapproval by courts and the only remedy the mortgagor had against fraud or other misconduct was by a bill in equity to set aside the conveyanee, or for redemption. In 1843 the legislature passed an act regulating the foreclosure of mortgages on real property which created a redemption period in favor of mortgagors, but the act did not purport to govern trust deeds containing a power of sale. Thereafter the foreclosing of mortgages was committed to courts of chancery, under their general equity powers, except as to certain prescribed matters of procedure. From that time mortgage foreclosure sales were made by an officer who was required to report the sale to the court. Purchasers did not become vested with any interest in the land sold until the report of sale was approved. The court fixed the terms and conditions of foreclosure sales and this practice still continues. In 1879 the legislature provided that no real estate should be sold by virtue of any power of sale contained in any mortgage, trust deed, or other conveyance in the nature of a mortgage, but that thereafter such real estate should be sold in the same manner provided for foreclosure of mortgages containing no power of sale, and then only in pursuance of a judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. (State Bar Stat. 1935, chap. 95, par. 24; 95 S. H. A. 23.) The history of this legislation is conclusive proof that it was the legislative intent that foreclosure sales should be made only upon such terms and conditions as were approved by the courts. Garrett v. Moss, 20 Ill. 549.</p> <p id="b287-3" pgmap="287(103) 288(66)">Unfairness from any cause which operates to the prejudice of an interested party, will abundantly justify a chancery court in refusing to approve a sale. We said in Roberts v. Goodin, 288 Ill. 561: “The setting aside of the sale and ordering the property re-sold was a matter which rested largely within the discretion of the chancellor, whose duty it was to see that the lien be enforced with the least damage possible to the property rights of the mortgagor. Counsel cite numerous cases touching their contention that the chancellor erred in setting aside this sale. The cases cited, however, arose after the sale had once been confirmed, and not where, as here, the objection to the confirmation of the sale was filed immediately after the sale and before any confirmation had taken place. The chancellor has a broad discretion in the matter of approving or disapproving a master’s sale made subject to the court’s approval by the terms of the decree.”</p> <p id="b288-3" pgmap="288">The legislature’s purpose would be defeated if any other interpretation were given to the statutes on the subject of mortgage foreclosure. It is unusual for land to bring its full, fair market value at a forced sale. While courts can not guarantee that mortgaged property will bring its full value, they can prevent unwarranted sacrifice of a debtor’s property. Mortgage creditors resort to courts of equity for relief and those courts prescribe equitable terms upon which they may receive that relief, and it is within their power to prevent creditors from taking undue and unconscionable advantage of debtors, under the guise of collecting a debt. A slight inadequacy is not sufficient reason to disapprove a master’s sale, but where the amount bid is so grossly inadequate that it shocks the conscience of a court of equity, it is the chancellor’s duty to disapprove the report of sale. Connely v. Rue, 148 Ill. 207; Kiebel v. Reick, 216 id. 474; Wilson v. Ford, 190 id. 614; Ballentyne v. Smith, 205 U. S. 285, 51 L. ed. 803.</p> <p id="b288-4" pgmap="288(113) 289(137)">The case of Slack v. Cooper, 219 Ill. 138, illustrates the rule. In that case the master sold the land, upon which the mortgage had been foreclosed, to the solicitor for the mortgagor for $3000. He acted under the mistaken impression that the buyer was the solicitor for the mortgagee, who appeared shortly thereafter and bid $7000. The master then announced publicly that since no cash had been deposited by the original bidder, and because of the misapprehension stated and his haste in making the sale, it would be re-opened for higher and better bids. At page 144 of that decision we said: “If the chancellor finds upon the coming in of the report of a master, that the sale as made is not to the best interest of all concerned and is inequitable, or that any fraud or misconduct has been practiced upon the master or the court or any irregularities in the proceedings, it is his duty to set aside the sale as made and order another sale of the premises. The chancellor has a broad discretion in passing upon the acts of the master and approving or disapproving his acts in reference to sales and entering his own decrees, (Quigley v. Breckenridge, 180 Ill. 627,) and his decree will not be disturbed by this court unless it is shown that he has abused his discretion and entered such an order or decree as would not seem equitable between the parties interested.”</p> <p id="b289-3" pgmap="289">We have limited our discussion to the power of a court of chancery to approve or disapprove a master’s report of sale in a foreclosure suit and we hold that the court has broad discretionary powers over such sales. Where it appears that the bid offered the court for the premises is so grossly inadequate that its acceptance amounts to a fraud, the court has the power to reject the bid and order a re-sale.</p> <p id="b289-4" pgmap="289(159) 290(95)">There is little or no difference between the equitable jurisdiction\' and power in a chancery court to refuse approval to a report of sale on foreclosure, and the power to fix, in advance, a reserved or upset price, as a minimum at which the property may be sold. We have referred to the acts of 1843 and 1879 which require trust deeds and mortgages to be foreclosed in chancery courts and have pointed out that courts of equity, exercising their general equity powers in such cases, have the right to fix reasonable terms and conditions for the carrying out of the provisions of the foreclosure decree, and that such courts may order a new sale and set the old aside for the violation of some duty by the master, or for fraud or mistake. No reason appears why the chancellor cannot prevent a sale at a grossly inadequate price by fixing á reasonable sale price in advance. The same judicial power \'is involved in either action. What is necessary to be done in the end, to prevent fraud and injustice, may be forestalled by proper judicial action in the beginning. Such a course is not against the policy of the law in this State and it is not the equivalent of an appraisal statute. It is common practice in both the State and Federal courts to fix an upset price in mortgage foreclosure suits. This is in harmony with the accepted principles governing judicial power in mortgage foreclosures.</p> <p id="b290-3" pgmap="290">In First National Bank v. Bryn Mawr Beach Building Corp. 365 Ill. 409, we pointed out the fact that such property as was there under consideration seldom sells at anything like its reproduction cost, or even its fair cash market value, at a judicial sale. We recognized the fact that the equity powers of State courts are no more limited than those of Federal courts, and that equity jurisdiction over mortgage foreclosures is general rather than limited or statutory. In part we said: “It would seem that since equity courts have always exercised jurisdiction to decree the enforcement of mortgage liens and to supervise foreclosure sales, such jurisdiction need not expire merely because the questions or conditions surrounding the exercise of such time-honored functions are new or complicated. If it may reasonably be seen that the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court of equity beyond the sale of the property will result in better protection to parties before it, it would seem not only to be germane to matters of undisputed jurisdiction, but to make for the highest exercise of the court’s admitted functions.” We there held that a court of equity has jurisdiction, in connection with an application for approval of a foreclosure sale, to approve a re-organization plan submitted by a bondholders’ committee. The question is somewhat different from that presented in the case before us, but we there recognized the continuing vitality and growth of equity jurisprudence.</p> <p id="b291-2" pgmap="291">Cases wherein an upset price has been fixed are not confined to large properties for which, by reason of their great value, the market is limited or there is no market whatever. In McClintic-Marshall Co. v. Scandinavian-American Building Co. 296 Fed. 601, a building was constructed on two lots covered by the mortgage, and one lot belonging to the mortgagor that was not mortgaged. It was necessary, under the circumstances, to sell all the property, and to protect the mortgagor a reserved price was fixed. The fact of an upset price is referred to, although there was no objection to it being fixed, in Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Boyd, 228 U. S. 482, 57 L. ed. 931, and Pewabic Mining Co. v. Mason, supra, and the power has been exercised in numerous other cases. 104 A. L. R. 375; 90 id. 1321; 88 id. 1481.</p> <p id="b291-3" pgmap="291">The appellant did not raise constitutional objections in the trial court and by appealing to the Appellate Court for the First District he would waive such questions. However, the fixing of an upset price does not violate section 10 of article 1 of the Federal constitution nor section 14 of article 2 of the Illinois constitution, which inhibit the impairment of the obligation of contracts. The reserved price dealt only with the remedy, and it was within the court’s power to establish it as one of the terms and conditions of the sale. The appellant was not deprived of his right to enforce the contract, and his remedy was neither denied, nor so embarrassed, as to seriously impair the value of his contract or the right to enforce it. Penniman’s Case, 103 U. S. 714, 26 L. ed. 502; Town of Cheney’s Grove v. Van Scoyoc, 357 Ill. 52.</p> <p id="b291-4" pgmap="291">It is contended that the present holding conflicts with what we said in Chicago Title and Trust Co. v. Robin, 361 Ill. 261. It was not necessary to that decision to pass upon the power to fix an upset price, and what we said on that subject is not adhered to.</p> <p id="b292-2" pgmap="292">Each case must be based upon its own facts, and from this record we are of the opinion that no such gross inadequacy existed in the bid of $50,000, as would warrant the chancellor in refusing approval of the master’s sale. Although the rents were pledged in the trust deed, they would amount to but little more than the taxes on the property of approximately $2000 per annum. Appellee’s affidavits base the estimate of value largely on the rental value of the premises. They were rented for $150 per month, plus $5 for each automobile sold by the lessee, and this amounted to a total of $200 a month. Even if the premises brought $400, or the $500 per month which appellee’s witnesses said could be had if the property was divided into storerooms, the cost of these changes is not given. This testimony did not warrant the chancellor in finding that these premises were worth $80,000. Although the property had been sold, before the panic, for $135,000, the value of real estate was greater then than at the time of the master’s sale. The proof did not sustain a greater value than $50,000 at the time of the sale, but if it be assumed- that this was somewhat inadequate, the fact that there was a depressed market for real estate would not be a sufficient circumstance, coupled with the supposed inadequacy in the bid, to warrant the chancellor in disapproving the master’s report of sale. The power to disapprove a sale for gross inadequacy of bid exists independent of an economic depression. The chancellor abused his discretion and erred in refusing to approve the sale at $50,000.</p> <p id="b292-3" pgmap="292">The judgment of the Appellate Court and the decree of the superior court are reversed and the cause is remanded to the superior court of Cook county, with directions to approve the master’s report of sale.</p> <p id="b292-4" pgmap="292">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p> </opinion> <opinion type="concurrence"> <author id="b292-5" pgmap="292">Stone and Shaw, JJ.,</author> <p id="ASY" pgmap="292">specially concurring:</p> <p id="b292-6" pgmap="292">We agree with the result reached but not in all that is said in the opinion.</p> </opinion> <opinion type="dissent"> <author id="b293-2" pgmap="293">Mr. Chief Justice Herrick,</author> <p id="ADM" pgmap="293">dissenting:</p> <p id="b293-3" pgmap="293">I concur in the legal conclusion reached in the majority opinion that the chancellor had the power to fix an upset price for the sale of the property against which foreclosure was sought. He set the upset price on the re-sale order at $71,508.45. He found that the market value of the property was $80,000. The majority opinion shows that the hearing as to the value of the property was on affidavits. Those of appellant tended to establish a value of $40,000 to $50,000; those of appellee, from $77,400 to $80,000. The upset price established by the chancellor was clearly within the scope of the evidence. This court has consistently held on issues\'involving the value of property, where the value was fixed by the verdict of a jury on conflicting evidence, that, in the absence of material error, this court would not disturb the finding of the jury where the amount determined was within the range of the evidence and not the result of passion and prejudice. (Department of Public Works v. Foreman Bank, 363 Ill. 13, 24.) In my opinion we should accord to the finding of the chancellor on the question of value the same credit we do to a verdict of a jury on that subject. The application of this rule to the instant cause would result in the affirmance of the decree. The judgment of the Appellate Court and the order of the superior court should each have been affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion type="dissent"> <author id="b293-4" pgmap="293">Mr. Justice Orr,</author> <p id="AU6" pgmap="293">also dissenting:</p> <p id="b293-5" pgmap="293">I disagree with that portion of the opinion holding that a court of chancery, in a foreclosure case, has inherent power to fix an upset price to be bid at the sale.

    # John Cannon was tried in the criminal court of Fulton County on an accusation containing three counts. Count I charged that in said county on July 24, 1943, he "did engage in and sell, as a retail dealer, distilled spirits and alcohol, without first obtaining a license from the State Revenue Commissioner of the State of Georgia." Count 2 charged that on July 24, 1943, he possessed forty-eight half pints and three pints of whisky in Fulton County, and had not been licensed by the State Revenue Commissioner to sell whisky as a retail or wholesale dealer. Count 3 charged that on September 24, 1943, in said county, he sold malt beverages as a retail dealer, without first securing a license from the State Revenue Commissioner. On the trial, after the close of the State's evidence, counsel for the accused made a motion that count 2 be stricken, and that a verdict for the defendant be directed on counts 1 and 3. The court sustained the motion as to counts 2 and 3, but overruled it as to count 1. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on count 1, and of not guilty on counts 2 and 3. Subsequently the defendant's certiorari was overruled by a judge of the superior court and that judgment is assigned as error. <span class="star-pagination">*Page 758</span>

J.</author>\n    <p id="AvZ1">This is the third appeal in this case; the first being from an order of the judge of the circuit court denying defendant bail, and resulting in an affirmance here. Ex parte Tyler, 17 Ala. App. 698, 89 South. 926. The second appeal was from a judgment of conviction for murder in the first degree resulting in a reversal by the Supreme Court. Tyler v. State, 207 Ala. 129, 92 South. 478.</p>\n    <p id="b398-14">The evidence offered by the state tended to show that the defendant, on December 12, 1920, while under the influence of liquor, went to the home of J. M. Tyler, defendant’s father, where the deceased was a guest visiting the widowed sister of the defendant, Mrs. Silvia; that defendant had protested against deceased’s attention to Mrs. Silvia; that when defendant arrived at the home of his father the deceased was playing with two, of Mrs. Silvia’s children in the kitchen, and that Mrs. Silvia and the baby were in the adjoining room; that defendant, without the slightest provocation or semblance of justification, shot the deceased, inflicting upon his person wounds that caused his death.</p>\n    <p id="b398-15">The defendant offered some evidence tending to show that he was on his way to his brother’s, carrying his brother some medicine; that he stopped by his father’s home, and entered the home by the kitchen door; that deceased seized and attacked\' him; and, in a scuffle for defendant’s pistol, the weapon was discharged, inflicting the wounds that caused the death of the deceased.</p>\n    <p id="b398-16">The defendant’s motion to quash the venire and his objecting to being put to trial because two of the veniremen drawn for the defendant’s trial had served as jurors on the former trial of the defendant was without merit, and was\'properly overruled. Stover v. State, 204 Ala. 311, 85 South. 393; Morris v. State, 18 Ala. App. 135, 90 South. 57.</p>\n    <p id="b398-17">The veniremen who had served on the jury on the previous trial were subject to challenge for cause and by exercising the right of challenge for cause, if they were objectionable to defendant, these veniremen would have been stricken from the list, without curtailing the defendant’s strikes or peremptory challenges. Wickard v. State,” 109 Ala. 45, 19 South. 491; Stover v. State, supra.</p>\n    <p id="b398-18">The question addressed to Mary Alexander, “Who -\\yere your physicians, who treated him?” and that addressed to Dr. Wilkinson, “How long have you known him (deceased) ?” were preliminary in character, and the defendant’s objection was properly overruled.</p>\n    <p id="b398-19"> There was evidence tending to show that the motive prompting the homicide was <page-number citation-index="1" label="383">*383</page-number>to put an end to the attention the deceased was showing Mrs. Silvia, and her testimony that her husband was dead, that she was living at her father’s, that she was the mother of the children present in the house at the time of the homicide, and the ages of the children, was not without relevancy as shedding light on the motive of the defendant and the conduct of the deceased at the( time of the homicide. While evidence as to motive is not essential, it is always competent. Jones v. State, 13 Ala. App. 10, 68 South. 690; Brunson v. State, 124 Ala. 40, 27 South. 410.</p>\n    <p id="b399-4"> It is not essential that a dying declaration, if made under a sense of impending death, should be wholly voluntary.</p>\n    <blockquote id="b399-5">They “are admitted upon the theory that the consciousness of approaching death dispels from the mind all motive for making a false statement, in view of the fact that the party recognizes the fact that he shall soon appear in the.presence of his Maker.” Parker v. State, 165 Ala. 1, 51 South. 260.</blockquote>\n    <p id="b399-6">The predicate was sufficient to authorize the admission of the dying declaration. Tyler v. State; 207 Ala. 129, 92 South. 478.</p>\n    <p id="b399-7">The testimony /Of the witness Mrs. George Silvia, given on the preliminary trial, was only admissible to impeach her testimony on the present trial, after proper predicate had beeji laid for such purpose, and the court properly admitted such as •tended to contradict her and corresponding to the several predicates laid on her cross-examination, and properly excluded the other portion of her testimony.</p>\n    <p id="b399-8">The witness, Mrs. E. S. Tyler, testified: “I did not say in that statement that Lon was drunk, but he must have been drunk or something, I reckon, but I don’t know how that was,” and so much of the written signed statement made by this witness, to wit, “Lon was drunk” was admissible to contradict her -testimony; hence the defendant’s general objection to all of the statement, was not well taken. Longmire v. State, 130 Ala. 67, 30 South. 413; Wright v. State, 136 Ala. 139, 145, 34 South. 233.</p>\n    <p id="b399-9">The solicitor, in his closing argument to the jury\', made the following statements to the jury: “We have got too much killing around here.” “Don’t you know we have.” “Do you know why?” The defendant objected to each of these statements and moved to exclude them because they were improper. The court overruled the defendant’s objection and motion and to these rulings the defendant reserved, exception.</p>\n    <p id="b399-10">In each of these rulings the court committed reversible error. The statement of the solicitor, “We have got too much killing around here,” was the statement of a fact, of which there was no evidence, and if evidence had been offered of this fact it would not have been admissible. Alabama Fuel <em>&amp; </em>Iron Co. v. Williams, 207 Ala. 99, 91 South. 879; McAdory v. State, 62 Ala. 154; Cross v. State, 68 Ala. 476; Flowers v. State, 15 Ala. App. 220, 73 South. 126; Strother v. State, 15 Ala. App. 106, 72 South. 566; B. R. L. &amp; P. Co. v. Drennen, 175 Ala. 349, 57 South. 876, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 1037; B’ham Ry. L. &amp; P. Co. v. Gonzalez, 183 Ala. 273, 61 South. 80, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 543.</p>\n    <p id="b399-12">In some of the authorities cited, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n    <blockquote id="b399-13">“However reluctant an appellate court may be to interfere with the discretion of a primary court in regulating the trial of causes, if it should appear that it had refused, to the prejudice of a party, to compel counsel to confine their arguments and comments to the jury, to the law and evidence of the case under consideration — if it had permitted them to.refer to and comment upon facts not in evidence, or which would not be admissible as evidence, it would be a fatal error.” 62 Ala. 163.</blockquote>\n    <blockquote id="b399-14">. “Now, there was not only no evidence before the jury of that other homicide, or its details, but such evidence, if offered, would have been illegal and irrelevant. This was not argument, and could furnish no .safe or permissible aid to the jury in considering and weighing the testimony before them. The jury\', in their deliberations, should consider no facts, save those given in evidence.” 68 Ala. 476.</blockquote>\n    <p id="b399-15">The statements here brought in question were not only argument, but their scope and. effect, however innocently made, was an appeal to the mob spirit to convict the defendant, regardless of the evidence because other killings had occurred in that county. The tendency and effect of their argument was to incense the minds of the jury and draw them away from the facts in the case. The defendant was entitled to have his case tried on the evidence, without regard to other killings. The argument of defendant’s counsel was clearly within the issues and the improper argument of the solicitor cannot be justified on the theory that it was made in answer to the argument of defendant’s attorney. . -</p>\n    <p id="b399-16">Charge 1, refused to the defendant, assumes that Lon Tyler was a guest at his father’s house, and was invasive of the province of the jury. Charge 2 is argumentative, elliptical, and otherwise faulty. Charge 4 is involved and relieved the defendant fr-om the duty of retreating. Charge 5 pretermits imminent danger. Charge 7 was properly refused; the burden is not on the state to “disprove” that defendant was not free from fault. Charge 8 is not the law. Charge 9 is bad. Deliberation and premeditation is not essential to murder in the second degree.</p>\n    <p id="b399-17">For the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed.</p>\n    <p id="b399-18">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    <author id="b399-19">PER CURIAM.</author>\n    <p id="ARX">Affirmed on authority of Ex parte State, ex rel.
